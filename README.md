# Tani Language Family Parallel Corpora

This repository contains parallel language corpora for the Tani language family, which includes dialects like Apatani, Adi, Nyishi, Galo, Tagin, and Misshng. The Tani ethnic group resides in the North-Eastern part of India, primarily in Arunachal Pradesh, and some also live in the Southern part of Tibet.

## About the Tani Ethnic Group

The Tani people, also known as the Tani-speaking tribes, are an ethnic group primarily inhabiting the state of Arunachal Pradesh in Northeast India and parts of Tibet. They are known for their diverse cultures, languages, and traditional practices. Here are some key points about the Tani ethnic group sourced from various references:

- **Diverse Linguistic Background**: The Tani people belong to the larger Tibeto-Burman language family. The Tani language family is known for its numerous dialects, with each dialect having its unique characteristics, vocabulary, and linguistic features.

- **Cultural Diversity**: The Tani people exhibit rich cultural diversity in terms of rituals, festivals, traditional attire, and social customs. Each Tani subgroup has its distinct cultural practices, although there are shared elements that unify them.

- **Socio-Economic Life**: Traditionally, the Tani people were primarily involved in agriculture, practicing terrace farming and cultivating rice, millet, and other crops. Over time, there have been changes in livelihoods, with some engaging in trade, government jobs, and other professions.

- **Religion and Beliefs**: The religious practices among the Tani people vary, including elements of animism, shamanism, and Buddhism. They have traditional beliefs tied to spirits, nature worship, and rituals associated with agricultural activities.

- **Geographical Distribution**: While a significant population resides in Arunachal Pradesh, especially in areas along the Subansiri River and Siang River valleys, some Tani groups also live in parts of Southern Tibet, maintaining their cultural and linguistic identities.
