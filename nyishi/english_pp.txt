The moral : 
The Wise Man
People have been coming to the wise man,
complaining about the same problems every time 
One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter 
After a couple of minutes,
he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled 
When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore 
The wise man smiled and said:
“You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over 
So why are you always crying about the same problem?”
Moral :Worrying won’t solve your problems, it’ll just waste your time and energy 
The Proud Rose
Once upon a time there was a rose who was very proud of her beautiful looks 
Her only disappointment was that she grew next to an ugly cactus 
Every day,
the rose would insult the cactus on his looks while the cactus stayed quiet 
All the other plants in the garden tried to make the rose see sense,
but she was too swayed by her own beauty 
One summer,
the well present in the garden grew dry,
and there was no water for the plants 
The rose began to wilt 
She saw a sparrow dip her beak into the cactus for some water 
Though ashamed,
she asked the cactus if she too could have some water 
The kind cactus readily agreed and they both got through the tough summer as friends 
Moral: Never judge someone by the way they look 
The Tale of the Pencil
Raj was upset because he had done poorly in his English test 
His grandmother sat beside him,
and gave him a pencil 
A puzzled Raj looked at his grandma and said he didn’t deserve a pencil after his performance in the test 
His grandma explained,
‘You can learn a great many things from this pencil because it is just like you 
It experiences a painful sharpening,
just the way you have experienced the pain of not doing well on your test 
However,
it will help you be a better student 
Just as all the good that comes from the pencil is from within itself,
you will also find the strength to overcome this hurdle 
And finally,
just as this pencil will make its mark on any surface,
you too shall leave your mark on anything you choose to’ 
Raj was immediately consoled and promised himself that he would do better 
Moral:We all have the strength to be who we wish to be 
The Foolish Donkey
A salt seller used to carry the salt bag on his donkey to the market every day,
On the way they had to cross a stream 
One day the donkey suddenly tumbled down the stream and the salt bag also fell into the water 
The salt dissolved in the water and hence the bag became very light to carry 
The donkey was happy 
Then the donkey started to play the same trick every day 
The salt seller came to understand the trick and decided to teach a lesson to it 
The next day he loaded a cotton bag on the donkey 
Again it played the same trick hoping that the cotton bag would be still become lighter 
But the dampened cotton became very heavy to carry and the donkey suffered 
It learnt a lesson 
It didn’t play the trick anymore after that day,
and the seller was happy 
Moral:Luck won’t favor always 
Moral:Luck won’t favor always 
The Cows And The Tiger
Four cows lived in a forest near a meadow 
They were good friends and did everything together 
They grazed together and stayed together,
because of which no tigers or lions were able to kill them for food 
But one day,
the friends fought and each cow went to graze in a different direction 
A tiger and a lion saw this and decided that it was the perfect opportunity to kill the cows 
They hid in the bushes and surprised the cows and killed them all,
one by one 
Moral: Unity is strength 
Elephant And Friends
A lone elephant wandered the forest looking for friends 
She came across a monkey and asked,
“Will you be my friend, monkey?”
“You are too big and cannot swing on trees as I do 
So I cannot be your friend”
, said the monkey 
The elephant them came across a rabbit and asked him if she could be his friend 
“You are too big to fit inside my burrow 
You cannot be my friend”,
replied the rabbit 
Then the elephant met a frog and asked if she could be her friend 
The frog said,
“You are too big and heavy 
You cannot jump like me 
I am sorry,
but you cannot be my friend” 
The elephant asked a fox,
and he got the same reply,
that he was too big 
The next day,
all the animals in the forest were running in fear 
The elephant stopped a bear and asked what was happening and was told that a tiger has been attacking all the animals 
The elephant wanted to save the other weak animals and went to the tiger and said
“Please sir,
leave my friends alone 
Do not eat them” 
The tiger didn’t listen and asked the elephant to mind her own business 
Seeing no other way to solve the problem,
the elephant kicked the tiger and scared it away 
She then went back to the others and told them what happened 
On hearing how the elephant saved their lives,
the animals agreed in unison,
“You are just the right size to be our friend” 
Moral:Friends come in all shapes and sizes!

It has begun 
It is a book 
It isn't Tom 
It isn't new 
It may break 
It scares me 
It was Tom's 
It was a bet 
It was black 
It was empty 
It was night 
It was white 
It works now 
It'll be hot 
It'll happen 
It's a curse 
It's a fruit 
It's a plant 
It's a steal 
It's at home 
It's bedtime 
It's bizarre 
It's correct 
It's for Tom 
It's for you 
It's immoral 
It's morning 
It's my book 
It's my life 
It's no good 
It's no joke 
It's not Tom 
It's not new 
It's only me 
It's our car 
It's perfect 
It's raining 
It's serious 
It's snowing 
It's strange 
It's too big 
It's too hot 
It's too low 
It's unusual 
It's useless 
It's working 
Jump over it 
Just get out 
Just go away 
Keep driving 
Keep it warm 
Keep looking 
Keep reading 
Keep singing 
Keep talking 
Keep walking 
Keep working 
Keep writing 
Ladies first 
Lead the way 
Let Tom come 
Let Tom live 
Let Tom sing 
Let Tom stay 
Let go of me!
Let me do it 
Let me dream 
Let me leave!
Let me think 
Let's go now 
Let's see it 
Let's try it 
Life is hard 
Life's short 
Listen to me 
Look at that 
Look at this 
Look closely 
Make it stop 
Mary came in 
Mary giggled 
Mary is cute 
Mary is mine 
Mary is tall 
Math is hard 
May I cut in?
May I go now?
May I try it?
Meat, please 
Men are pigs 
Move quietly 
Must I hurry?
My arm hurts 
My ears hurt 
My eyes hurt 
My feet hurt 
My hip hurts 
My jaw hurts 
No one cared 
No one knows 
Nobody asked 
Nobody slept 
Now I get it 
Oh, be quiet 
Pick that up 
Play it cool 
Please do it 
Please hurry!
Please relax 
Please smile 
Pull it open 
Put it there 
Say it again 
School's out

Shame on you

She needs it 
She shot him 
She stood up

She was busy 
She went out 
Should we go?
Show me that 
Speak louder 
Speak slower 
Speak softly 
Stay a while 
Stay at home 
Stay with me 
Stay with us 
Stop filming 
Stop humming 
Stop it, Tom 
Stop reading 
Stop singing 
Stop smoking 
Stop staring 
Stop yelling!
Sweet dreams!
Take a break 
Take it away 
Take it home 
Take me home 
Take my coat 
Take us home 
Tell Tom why 
Tell me more 
Thanks again 
That was Tom 
That was bad

Things break 
This is easy 
This is fine 
This is food 
This is gold 
This is hers 
This is just 
This is life!
This is love 
This is ours 
This is sick 
This is true 
This is ugly 
This'll help 
This'll work

You must eat 
You promised 
You scare me 
You'll do it 
You're a spy 
You're cruel 
You're dirty 
You're drunk 
You're dying 
You're fired 
You're funny 
You're great 
You're lying 
You're moody 
You're naive 
You're right 
You're sharp 
You're silly 
You're small 
You're tired 
You're tough 
You're upset 
You're vague 
You're young 
You've grown 
You've tried 
A car hit Tom 
A car went by 
Add some salt 
Am I dreaming?
Am I mistaken?
Am I safe now?
Any questions?
Anything else?
Are they busy?
Are they dead?
Are they gone?
Give it a try 
Give it to me 
Give me a day 
Give me a few 
Give me a hug 
Give me those 
God bless you!
Hang in there 
Have him come 
Have some tea 
He came first 
He can't read 
He can't sing 
He can't swim 
He eats a lot 
He ignored me 
He is English 
He is a thief 
He is my type!
He is reading 
He is running 
He kissed her 
He knows lots 
He left early 
He lied to me 
He lied to us 
He liked that 
He loves them 
He made me go 
He needs help 
He never lies 
He seems kind 
He sells cars 
He shot at me 
He smells bad 
He talks fast 
He talks well 
He tries hard 
He walks fast 
He wants more 
He was crying 
He went blind 
He's after me 
He's annoying 
He's friendly 
He's in Tokyo 
He's innocent 
He's not home 
He's not sick 
He's studying 
He's very ill 
Help yourself 
Here he comes 
Hey, don't go 
Hi, everybody 
His nose bled 
Hold on a sec 
Hold on there 
Hold on to it 
Hold on to me 
Hold the rope 
How about you?
I have doubts 
I have failed 
I have had it 
I have orders 
I have sinned 
I have to run 
I have to try 
I have to win 
I hear voices 
I hope we win 
I just did it

I must go out 
I must refuse 
I must resist 
I must see it 
I nearly died

I own a horse 
I put it back 
I quite agree 
I ran outside 
I read a book 
I rely on Tom 
I rescued her 
I rescued him 
I rescued you 
I respect Tom 
I said I'd go 
I said get up!
I said thanks 
I saw Tom die 
I saw a mouse!
I saw a plane 
I saw it, too 
I saw nothing 
I saw someone 
I say it's OK 
I see a house 
I see the boy 
I slept a lot

I was correct 
I was furious 
I was invited 
I was jealous 
I was serious 
I was so cold 
I was tempted 
I was too shy 
I was worried 
I wasn't busy 
I wasn't home 
I watched Tom 
I watched you 
I went aboard 
I went hiking 
I went inside 
I will listen 
I woke Tom up 
I woke you up 
I won't dance 
I won't laugh 
I won't leave 
I write songs 
I'd like that 
I'll be alone

I'm Tom's dad 
I'm Tom's mom 
I'm a cripple 
I'm a patient 
I'm a student 
I'm a suspect 
I'm a teacher 
I'm afraid so 
I'm all right 
I'm alone now 
I'm an addict 
I'm an orphan 
I'm at school 
I'm attentive 
I'm beautiful 
I'm busy here 
I'm busy, too 
I'm coming in 
I'm concerned 
I'm convinced 
I'm depressed 
I'm down here 
I'm exhausted 
I'm expecting 
I'm going mad 
I'm here, too 
I'm home, Tom 
I'm impatient 
I'm important 
I'm impressed 
I'm in Boston 
I'm in a gang 
I'm in danger 
I'm in denial 
I'm in my car 
I'm in school 
I'm just lazy 
I'm listening 
I'm miserable 
I'm motivated 
I'm no expert 
I'm not alone 
I'm not angry!
I'm not armed 
I'm not brave

I'm over here 
I'm ready now 
I'm safe here 
I'm satisfied 
I'm saying no 
I'm screaming 
I'm surprised 
I'm too tired 
Is that yours?
Is this Latin?
Is this Tom's?
Is this legal?
Is this yours?
Isn't it true?
It came apart 
It did happen 
It gets worse 
It had snowed 
It hurts here 
It is a curse 
It is no joke 
It is raining 
It is snowing 
It is too hot 
It isn't easy 
It isn't good 
It isn't mine 
It looks fine 
It looks good 
It might rain 
It sickens me 
It smells bad 
It takes time 
It was a gift 
It was a joke 
It was a trap 
It was simple 
It was stupid 
It was superb 
It was urgent 
It won't hurt 
It won't work 
It works well 
It'll be fine 
It'll be good 
It's Saturday 
It's a fungus 
It's a relief 
It's a secret 
It's accurate 
It's all mine 
It's all over 
It's an order 
It's annoying 
It's business 
It's exciting 
It's fall now 
It's gorgeous 
It's happened 
It's hopeless 
It's hot here 
It's improved 
It's inhumane 
It's midnight 
It's my fault 
It's my horse 
It's my money 
It's my treat 
It's not cold 
It's not easy 
It's not fair 
It's not gold 
It's not good 
It's not here 
It's not mine 
It's not true 
It's occupied 
It's possible 
It's so quiet 
It's too cold 
It's too dark 
It's too easy 
It's too hard 
It's too late 
It's too long 
It's too thin 
It's too ugly 
It's unlikely 
It's unlocked 
It's up to me 
It's up to us 
It's upstairs 
It's very big 
It's very hot 
It's very new 
Just a minute 
Just a moment 
Just check it 
Just find Tom 
Keep Tom busy 
Keep climbing 
Keep in touch!
Keep it quiet 
Let Tom do it 
Let Tom drive 
Let Tom sleep 
Let Tom speak 
Let go of Tom 
Let him do it 
Let him enter 
Let me try it 
Let them talk 
Let's ask him 
Let's eat now 
Let's eat out 
Let's go away 
Let's go back 
Let's go home 
Let's keep it 
Let's move on 
Let's open it 
Let's proceed 
Life is crazy 
Life is short 
Life is tough 
Life's unfair 
Listen to Tom 
Lock the door!
Look at these 
Look at those 
Look in there 
Look up there 
Love is blind 
Make me happy 
Make your bed 
Man is mortal 
Mary is a fox 
Mary is weird 
May I ask why?
May I come in?
May I go home?
Men never cry 
Mine is black 
Mom's at work 
My back hurts 
My car is red 
My dog ate it 
My dog is big 
My foot hurts 
My hair's wet 
My head aches 
My knee hurts 
My name's Tom 
My neck hurts 
My pen is new 
Night came on 
No one saw me 
No one saw us 
No one's here 
No one's home 
No, thank you 
Nobody called 
Nobody saw me 
Nobody's busy 
Now I'm angry 
Now I'm ready 
Now you do it 
OK, I'm ready 
OK, listen up 
Oh, I'm sorry 
Only Tom left 
Open the door 
Open the gate

Our team lost 
Owls are cute 
Pass it to me 
People change 
Play it again 
Quiet, please

Speak clearly 
Speak quietly 
Start running

They're tired

I'm left-handed 
I'm married now 
I'm my own boss 
I'm nearsighted 
I'm nervous now 
I'm never wrong 
I'm new at this 
I'm new in town 
I'm not a child 
I'm not a crook 
I'm not a saint 
I'm not a thief 
I'm not a woman 
I'm not arguing

I'm now married 
I'm now unarmed 
I'm on my break 
I'm on the list 
I'm on the roof 
I'm on vacation 
I'm out of here 
I'm ready to go 
I'm really fast 
I'm really rich 
I'm replaceable 
I'm so confused 
I'm still alive 
I'm still angry 
I'm still young 
I'm texting Tom 
I'm the bad one 
I'm too ashamed 
I'm unimpressed 
I'm very afraid 
I'm very hungry 
I'm very lonely 
I'm very scared 
I'm very strict 
I'm very strong 
I'm watching TV 
I'm your father 
I'm your waiter 
I've been fired 
I've been wrong 
I've cut myself 
I've enjoyed it 
I've got a book

Isn't Tom funny?

Isn't that mine?
Isn't that ours?
It can't be Tom 
It could be Tom 
It didn't break 
It doesn't hurt 
It doesn't work 
It has to be me 
It is necessary 
It is seven now 
It is up to you 
It isn't a fish 
It looked cheap 
It makes me sad 
It may seem odd 
It might be Tom 
It might be fun 
It must be here 
It must be true 
It really works 
It snowed a lot 
It sounds great!
It tasted sweet 
It took all day 
It was from Tom 
It was my fault 
It was painless 
It was terrific 
It was too easy 
It was too late 
It was worth it 
It wasn't funny 
It would be fun 
It'll rain soon 
It's OK with me 
It's Tom's duty 
It's Tom's idea 
It's a bad time 
It's a dead end 
It's a fine day 
It's a new book 
It's a nice day 
It's a shortcut 
It's a surprise 
It's about time 
It's acceptable 
It's all I have 
It's all I need 
It's almost six 
It's been tried 
It's cold today 
It's fine today 
It's going fine 
It's impossible 
It's incredible 
It's just a cat 
It's just blood 
It's like magic 
It's lunch time 
It's misleading 
It's my day off 
It's news to me 
It's no problem 
It's not Monday 
It's not a fish 
It's not a game 
It's not a gift 
It's not a joke 
It's not broken 
It's not enough 
It's not my car 
It's not my day 
It's not so far 
It's not stupid 
It's okay to go 
It's really Tom 
It's ridiculous 
It's still dark 
It's still mine 
It's sufficient 
It's terrifying 
It's time to go 
It's very cheap 
It's very clean 
It's very small 
It's very white 
It's warm today 
It's your fault 
It's your money 
Jesus loves you 
Just follow Tom 
Just ignore Tom 
Just let Tom go 
Just stay close 
Just try it out 
Just wrap it up 
Keep Tom inside 
Keep me updated 
Keep on smiling 
Keep on working 
Keep practicing 
Keep the change!
Keep the secret 
Kids need sleep 
Kiss Tom for me 
Large, isn't it?
Lead is a metal 
Leave Tom alone 
Leave a message 
Leave him alone 
Leave our house 
Lemons are sour 
Let Tom do that 
Let Tom do this 
Let Tom go home 
Let me call Tom 
Let me carry it 
Let me go alone 
Let me go first 
Let me help you 
Let me see that 
Let us help Tom 
Let's ditch Tom 
Let's eat sushi 
Let's fly kites 
Let's get a cab 
Let's get drunk 
Let's go by bus 
Let's go by car 
Let's improvise 
Let's live here 
Let's negotiate 
Let's play ball 
Let's rest here 
Let's stop here 
Let's talk soon 
Let's thank Tom 
Let's try again 
Let's turn back 
Let's visit Tom 
Let's wait here 
Life ain't easy 
Life is a dream 
Life is strange 
Life isn't fair 
Listen a minute 
Look around you 
Look at the cat 
Look at the sky 
Look behind you 
Look what I did 
Make a decision 
Make it smaller 
Many admire him 
Mary helped Tom 
Mary is a widow 
Mary is my wife 
Mary sings alto 
Mary's my niece 
May I come, too?
May I go to bed?
May I interrupt?
May I leave now?
May I try it on?
Maybe it's true 
Men should work 
Merry Christmas!
Might I come in?
Mistakes happen 
Mom has a fever 
Mom, I'm hungry

My cat is white 
My dog is white 
My father is in 
My house is big 
My jeans shrank 
My work is done 
Never lose hope 
Never say never 
Never tell lies 
Never trust Tom 
Nice seeing you!
Nice to see you 
No one answered 
No one can tell 
No one has come 
No one is there 
No one knew why 
No one likes it 
No one likes me 
No one loves me 
No one saw that 
No one was late 
No taxi stopped 
Nobody answered 
Nobody loves me 
Nobody needs me 
Nobody was home 
Nobody's hungry 
Nothing changes 
Now is the time 
Now stand still 
Now stop crying 
Now you're safe 
October is over 
Only Tom smiled 
Only Tom stayed 
Open the bottle 
Open the window 
Open your mouth!
Our plan worked 
Pandas are cute 
Parties are fun 
Parties bore me 
Pass me the pen

Please hurry up!
Please sit down!

Please, tell me 
Put on your hat 
Put your hat on 
Raise your hand 
Read this first 
Rejection hurts 
Remove your hat 
Repeat after me 
Rules are rules 
Say no to drugs 
Say you love me 
School bores me 
See what I mean?
See you at home 
See you tonight 
Send it by mail 
Shall we go now?

Why weren't you able to do that?
Why weren't you at school today?
Wild animals live in the forest 
Wild animals live in the jungle 
Will Tom be here this afternoon?
Will you be doing that tomorrow?
Will you be in Boston next week?
Will you call me a taxi, please?
Will you excuse us for a moment?
Will you go to Boston next week?
Will you help me move this desk?
Will you help me translate this?
Will you please stop teasing me?
Will you sell your house to him?
Will you study French next year?
Winning a trophy made Tom happy 
Winning is more fun than losing 
Without air, nothing could live 
Women aren't allowed to do that 
Won't you have some more coffee?
Wooden houses catch fire easily 
Words cannot convey my feelings 
World war two broke out in 1939 
Would anyone else like to speak?
Would you be willing to do that?
Would you care for a cup of tea?
Would you check the oil, please?
Would you give me Tom's address?
Would you like a cup of tea now?
Would you like a glass of water?
Would you like a second helping?
Would you like a second serving?
Would you like another sandwich?
Would you like bacon or sausage?
Would you like half my sandwich?

Writing news stories is his job 
Yes, someone actually said that 
Yesterday a truck hit this wall 
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog 
Yesterday, I cooked Okonomiyaki 
Yesterday, he told me the truth 
You all remember Tom, don't you?
You always order the same thing 
You always take things too easy 
You are a good cook, aren't you?
You are always as busy as a bee 
You are in very serious trouble 
You are not to blame, nor is he 
You are old enough to know this 
You are too young to be in love 
You are twice as strong as I am 
You are very early this morning 
You ask me to do the impossible 
You can do anything you want to 
You can do whatever you want to 
You can eat as much as you want 
You can go home now if you like 
You can go or stay, as you wish 
You can reach me at this number 
You can rent a boat by the hour 
You can run, but you can't hide 
You can speak French, can't you?
You can use my desk if you want 
You can't always avoid problems 
You can't be happy all the time 
You can't be two places at once 
You can't do anything right now 
You can't do that  It's illegal 
You can't do two things at once 
You can't expect more than that 
You can't force me to marry you 
You can't have any of this cake 
You can't just sit here all day 
You can't make someone love you 
You can't make up for lost time 
You can't pick who you fall for 
You can't put a price on a life 
You can't put it off any longer 
You can't seat Tom next to Mary 
You can't shoot Tom in the back 
You can't speak French, can you?
You can't survive without money 
You can't talk to Tom like that 
You could get arrested for that 
You could have heard a pin drop 
You desperately need a vacation 
You did that exceptionally well 
You didn't say how much it cost 
You do understand me, don't you?
You do your thing, I'll do mine 
You don't have to come tomorrow 
You don't have to do that today 
You don't have to tell me twice 
You don't know a thing about me 
You don't know what Tom is like 
You don't like gambling, do you?
You don't need to come so early 
You don't need to keep anything 
You don't need to worry anymore 
You don't seem to be very happy 
You don't seem too enthusiastic 
You don't sound very optimistic 
You don't speak English, do you?
You don't understand women, Tom 
You don't want to say no to Tom 
You guys love each other, right?
You guys should be more careful 
You had a good time, didn't you?
You had better look up the word 
You had better not stay up late 
You had better take an umbrella 
You have lovely eyes, don't you?
You have my permission to leave 
You have nothing to prove to us 
You have nothing to worry about 
You have our total support, Tom 
You have something on your face 
You have the right to the truth 
You have to answer the question 
You have to believe in yourself 
You have to get him to help you 
You have to take the first step 
You have totally lost your mind 
You haven't done anything wrong 
You haven't seen the last of me 
You just saved me a lot of time 
You know I would never hurt you 
You know quite a lot about Sumo 
You know some French, don't you?
You know that I don't like eggs 
You know what I want, don't you?
You know where it is, don't you?
You know where the problem lies 
You look gorgeous in that dress 
You made the same mistake again 
You may do whatever you want to 
You may go home now if you like 
You may invite whoever you like 
You might find this interesting 
You must not be late for school 
You must not go there with them 
You must obey the traffic rules 
You must read between the lines 
You must return the book to him 
You must've had a great weekend 
You mustn't keep a lady waiting 
You need not have come so early 
You need to answer the question 
You need to do better than that 
You need to start meeting women 
You need to stop being so pushy 
You need to try a little harder 
You never answered the question 
You noticed it, too, didn't you?
You ought not to have done that 
You ought to ask him for advice 
You owe me another thirty bucks 
You probably think Mary is cute 
You really know your stuff, Tom 
You said that Tom wasn't hungry 
You said you could speak French 
You said you had important news 
You seem to make friends easily 
You shall not marry my daughter!
You should allow Tom to do that 
You should be proud of yourself 
You should come back here again 
You should come over after work 
You should consider the problem 
You should express your opinion 
You should follow Tom's example 
You should have one of us do it 
You should lower your standards 
You should never have done that 
You should really get a haircut 
You should stay here a few days 
You should think about it first 
You should try some of this pie 
You should try to behave better 
You should've come to the party 
You should've gone home already 
You should've gotten up earlier 
You should've told me the truth 
You should've told me yesterday 
You shouldn't eat between meals 
You shouldn't have any problems 
You shouldn't play with matches 
You sound very sure of yourself 
You stole the money, didn't you?
You think I'm stupid, don't you?
You took some unnecessary risks 
You two seem to hate each other 
You were a bully in high school 
You were never much of a talker 
You were right about everything 
You were told this would happen 
You were very busy, weren't you?
You will be rewarded handsomely 
You will be welcome at any time 
You will never know where he is 
You will not get away with this 
You won't be needing that again 
You won't believe what happened 
You'd better consult the doctor 
You'd better keep that a secret 
You'd better not argue with Tom 
You'd better not go there again 
You'd better tell him the truth 
You'd better watch what you say 
You'll feel better after a bath 
You'll have to ask someone else 
You'll have to be more specific 
You'll have to look out for Tom 
You'll need this more than I do 
You'll never guess what I found 
You'll never guess what Tom did 
You'll understand it right away 
You're Tom's friend, aren't you?
You're a better dancer than Tom 
You're always welcome here, Tom 
You're better at this than I am 
You're contradicting yourselves 
You're going to freeze to death 
You're going to have to do that 
You're going to ruin everything 
You're good at this, aren't you?
You're here awfully early today 
You're in no condition to drive 
You're lucky Tom didn't hit you 
You're not studying hard enough 
You're not too old for this job 
You're not very hungry, are you?
You're not welcome here anymore 
You're not working here anymore 
You're old enough to understand 
You're taking a lot for granted 
You're the best man for the job 
You're the tallest woman I know 
You're too young to get married 
You're used to that, aren't you?
You're very good at what you do 
You're very mature for your age 
You're wasting both of our time 
You're welcome to borrow my car 
You're welcome to give it a try 
You've got bags under your eyes 
You've got no right to say that 
You've lost weight, haven't you?
You've made your position clear 
You've missed an important clue 
Your CV has really impressed me 
Your English has improved a lot 
Your answer is far from perfect 
Your attendance isn't necessary 
Your bicycle is similar to mine 
Your clothes are out of fashion 
Your friend's in the other room 
Your idea is not entirely crazy 
Your kiss is sweeter than honey 
Your mother is going to kill me 
Your name sounds familiar to me 
Your order has been carried out 
Your parents know where you are 
Your problem is similar to mine 
Your question is hard to answer 
Your shirt button is coming off 
Are you happy now?  Yes, I am  
Do you love me?  I don't know  
Fast is the opposite of  slow  
How old are you?  I'm sixteen  
I'm Japanese, the boy answered 
Let me alone, she said angrily 
Let's play tennis   Yes let's  
Tom likes Mary   Yeah, I know  
Why did Tom do that?  Do what? 
You're blushing!  No, I'm not

Africa is a very large continent 
After he said it, he was ashamed

All his life Tom was an outsider 
All of the students were present 
All of them were handmade things 
All prices are subject to change 
All the boys were looking at Tom 
All the players were in position 
All these devices are unreliable

All we need is a little patience 
Almost all of the dogs are alive 
Almost all the doors were closed 
Am I ever going to see you again?
An ambulance arrived immediately

Armenia is a mountainous country 
As far as I know, Tom is retired 
As far as I know, he is reliable 
As time passes, wisdom increases 
Ask Tom what he thinks of Boston 
Ask at the police box over there

At that time, we were quite rich 
At what time will you be leaving?

I bought a camera for 30 dollars 
I bought the same shirt as yours 
I bought this book the other day 
I bought this watch at the store 
I brought you a little something

I came here to make you an offer 
I can assure you that's not true 
I can be just as stubborn as you 
I can do that with my bare hands 
I can drive a car, but Tom can't

I haven't seen him in a few days 
I haven't seen you around before 
I hear that his father is abroad 
I hear you've got a new nickname 
I heard a shout and then a crash 
I heard someone opening the door 
I heard that Tom has passed away 
I heard that you two had a fight 
I heard you talking on the phone 
I heard you wanted to talk to me 
I helped Tom move some furniture 
I helped my father with the work 
I hid from Tom behind the garage 
I hope I made the right decision 
I hope I'm wrong, but I doubt it 
I hope Tom knows what he's doing 
I hope Tom won't be disappointed 
I hope he hasn't had an accident 
I hope it does not rain tomorrow 
I hope my boss agrees to my plan 
I hope no one saw me kissing Tom 
I hope nobody saw me kissing Tom 
I hope nobody saw you doing that 
I hope that doesn't happen again 
I hope that she'll get well soon 
I hope that this isn't a mistake 
I hope the economy picks up soon 
I hope the fog will go away soon 
I hope this seat is not occupied 
I hope we have a white Christmas 
I immediately accepted his offer 
I injured myself during PE class 
I intend to go back to Australia 
I invited my neighbors to dinner 
I just don't think it's possible 
I just finished reading the book 
I just got a letter from my girl 
I just got out of a relationship 
I just happened to be driving by 
I just have one question for you 
I just saw Tom and Mary together 
I just started reading this book 
I just want a little more coffee 
I just want to go home and sleep 
I just woke up a few minutes ago 
I knew her the instant I saw her 
I knew something Tom didn't know 
I knew what I was supposed to do 
I know I'm doing the right thing 
I know Tom isn't very happy here 
I know Tom would love to see you 
I know a good Italian restaurant 
I know a good store that's cheap 
I know a lot of good restaurants 
I know everything I need to know 
I know exactly what I have to do 
I know exactly what you're doing 
I know now that Tom was mistaken 
I know that Tom is overconfident 
I know that Tom isn't a Canadian 
I know that Tom likes basketball 
I know that you know that I know 
I know this must come as a shock 
I know what Tom's car looks like 
I know what those books are like 
I know what you did in Australia 
I know where Tom hides his money 
I know who you're thinking about 
I know why Tom doesn't like Mary 
I know why you aren't happy here 
I know you're disappointed in me 
I know you've been through a lot 
I laid my new clothes on the bed 
I left halfway through the movie 
I let my friend copy my homework 
I like American movies very much 
I like summer better than winter 
I like taking walks in the woods 
I like the one with a white belt 
I like the way Tom makes me feel 
I like to paint with watercolors 
I like to take a shower at night 
I like to watch TV in my Jacuzzi 
I like watching movies in French 
I like winter better than summer 
I liked your idea and adopted it 
I live next door to the toy shop 
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo 
I lived in Japan three years ago 
I lived in this house as a child 
I lost sight of her in the crowd 
I love french fries with ketchup 
I love the sound of church bells 
I love the sound of rain falling 
I love things that are beautiful 
I love to paint with watercolors 
I love you more than anyone else 
I love you more than you love me 
I made a bad mistake on the test 
I made up my mind to be a doctor 
I meet him sometimes in the club 
I might as well get a head start 
I might be able to figure it out 
I might work in Boston next year 
I missed you very much yesterday 
I mostly agree with what he said 
I must admit that I was mistaken 
I need a good pair of sunglasses 
I need some sugar to make a cake 
I need someone who I can talk to 
I need to ask you some questions 
I need to cancel my subscription 
I need to catch up on some sleep 
I need to declutter my apartment 
I need to figure out who's lying 
I need to know how this happened 
I need to practice a little more 
I need to talk to you about that 
I need to talk to you about this 
I neither heard nor saw anything 
I never had to worry about money 
I never heard you play it better 
I never thought I'd be this busy 
I now live in a very small house 
I offered to fix Tom's flat tire 
I often go swimming in the river 
I often heard her sing that song 
I often play soccer after school 
I often receive letters from him 
I only asked Tom to pay his bill 
I only have fifty meters of rope 
I only have one thing left to do 
I only know that Tom isn't happy 
I only told you what Tom told me 
I only want the money you owe me 
I ordered them to leave the room 
I participated in the discussion 
I passed the exam and so did Tom 
I plan to be here for three days 
I plan to go to France next year 
I played violin when I was a kid 
I played with Tom and Mary today 
I prefer to study in the morning 
I prefer translation to teaching 
I prepared a weak sugar solution 
I pretended that I didn't see it 
I pricked my thumb with a needle 
I promise I'll be there tomorrow 
I promise you I'll keep you safe 
I promised him to keep it secret 
I put my family before my career 
I ran all the way to the station 
I read that book a long time ago 
I read the whole book in one day 
I read this book again and again 
I realize it's probably too late 
I really can't make any promises 
I really don't want to live here 
I really don't want to miss that 
I received your letter yesterday 
I recognized him at first glance 
I refuse to discuss the question 
I regret having said that to him 
I regret that I can't come today 
I regret what happened yesterday 
I remember how angry you made me 
I saw a bum at the train station 
I saw many tourists on the beach 
I saw that movie a long time ago 
I saw that movie three years ago 
I saw the moon above the horizon 
I saw your brother the other day 
I see you've been shopping again 
I seem to have caught a bad cold 
I seem to have misplaced my keys 
I share this room with my sister 
I should just tell Tom the truth 
I should've asked Tom for advice 
I should've done this months ago 
I should've stayed at home today 
I shouldn't have brought this up 
I shouldn't have downloaded that 
I shouldn't have gone to see Tom 
I shouldn't have sent that email 
I solved the problem in this way 
I sometimes meet Tom at the club 
I sometimes play tennis with her 
I speak Chinese almost every day 
I speak French every day at work 
I speak French with Tom and Mary 
I spent my vacation at the beach 
I spent my vacation in Australia 
I spent the weekend with friends 
I spoke to the principal himself 
I stared back at her in surprise 
I stayed there until he had left 
I still don't know what happened 
I still have about three minutes 
I still have some homework to do 
I study French because I have to 
I suggest that we leave now, Tom 
I suggest that you don't do that 
I suggest you stay away from Tom 
I suggest you stay out of my way 
I swept the floor in the kitchen 
I take a shower almost every day 
I take back everything I've said 
I take the bus to work every day 
I talked to her on the telephone 
I tend to laugh when I'm nervous 
I thank you for your cooperation 
I think I can handle this myself 
I think I know as much as you do 
I think I know what Tom is doing 
I think I left the water running 
I think I might be a little late 
I think I might've caught a cold 
I think I speak French very well 
I think I won't go to work today 
I think I'm a pretty good writer 
I think I'm a pretty normal girl 
I think I've forgotten something 
I think Tom and Mary are in love 
I think Tom didn't like the food 
I think Tom doesn't like it here 
I think Tom is expecting us both 
I think Tom is going to call you 
I think Tom is smarter than Mary 
I think Tom might know something 
I think Tom will be able to help 
I think Tom would tell the truth 
I think everyone had a good time 
I think he is planning something 
I think it is a mere coincidence 
I think it's a pity that he lied 
I think it's going to rain today 
I think it's wrong to tell a lie 
I think life is what you make it 
I think men can live on the moon 
I think online dating isn't safe 
I think our relationship is over 
I think that Tom is still sleepy 
I think that Tom is too trusting 
I think that Tom won't get bored 
I think that girl's name is Mary 
I think that his novel is boring 
I think that price is reasonable 
I think that she knows the truth 
I think that they were all fired 
I think that we should try again 
I think that's a lot of malarkey 
I think that's for Tom to decide 
I think the train will come soon 
I think they did that on purpose 
I think this is the way to do it 
I think we can finish this later 
I think we can go on our way now 
I think we need more information 
I think you should eat something 
I think you should get more rest 
I think you're a really nice guy 
I think you're going to do great 
I think you're going to like Tom 
I think you're wasting your time 
I thought I told you not to come 
I thought I'd try doing it again 
I thought Tom and Mary were busy 
I thought Tom would like to know 
I thought nothing could go wrong 
I thought that Tom was in Boston 
I thought they offered you a job 
I thought they wouldn't like you 
I thought you might want a drink 
I thought you might've left town 
I thought you missed your flight 
I thought you'd be happy for Tom 
I thought you'd be home studying 
I thought you'd like to see this 
I thought you'd want to see this 
I told you Tom would help us out 
I told you before not to do that 
I told you never to call me here 
I told you you'd be disappointed 
I took Tom's umbrella by mistake 
I took the wheels off Tom's bike 
I touched the bottom of the pool 
I tried not to look disappointed 
I tried to swim across the river 
I trust that I can see you again 
I understand, but I cannot agree 
I used to be pretty good at this 
I used to go to church on Sunday 
I used to have that same problem 
I usually go to sleep very early 
I usually stay indoors on Sunday 
I visited Boston a long time ago 
I visited my grandmother's house 
I waited for Tom for a long time 
I waited for Tom for three hours 
I want a piece of chocolate cake 
I want a single room if possible 
I want to ask you some questions 
I want to be able to read French 
I want to become a good listener 
I want to breathe some fresh air 
I want to buy a cheap dictionary 
I want to declutter my apartment 
I want to find out what happened 
I want to get a sightseeing visa 
I want to get to know you better 
I want to go to America some day 
I want to go to the movies today 
I want to go to the zoo with Tom 
I want to have a job that I love 
I want to increase my vocabulary 
I want to know who told Tom that 
I want to make a good impression 
I want to open my own restaurant 
I want to see him no matter what 
I want to send a parcel to Japan 
I want to spend my life with you 
I want to study abroad next year 
I want you here tomorrow by 2:30 
I want you to be my friend again 
I want you to find out about Tom 
I want you to get me out of here 
I want you to stay where you are 
I want you to tell me everything 
I want you to turn off the radio 
I wanted to become a philosopher 
I wanted to do something for Tom 
I wanted to introduce you to Tom 
I warned you that Tom was coming 
I was bitten on the leg by a dog 
I was born on October 10th, 1972 
I was deceived by her appearance 
I was expecting you at 11:00 a m 
I was hoping that you might know 
I was in the hospital for a week 
I was just thinking of a new job 
I was just trying to be friendly 
I was just trying to impress Tom 
I was just trying to protect you 
I was late for work this morning 
I was laughed at in school today 
I was nearly run over by a truck 
I was surprised at the discovery 
I was surprised to get your call 
I was taking a bath when he came 
I was taught something different 
I was tired, so I didn't do that 
I was too tired to go on working 
I was unable to stand any longer 
I was vaccinated against the flu 
I was very glad to hear the news 
I was very moved by her kindness 
I was very surprised at the news 
I was with Tom the night he died 
I washed the dishes after supper 
I wasn't happy with Tom's answer 
I watch a lot of gangster movies 
I went as far as the post office 
I went skiing at Zao last winter 
I went to Bali on summer holiday 
I went to sleep about 10 o'clock 
I went to the hospital yesterday 
I went to the scene of the crime 
I will ask him about it tomorrow 
I will do everything in my power 
I will go there even if it rains 
I will never violate a law again 
I will not go to school tomorrow 
I will try to eat it in one bite 
I wish I could be there with you 
I wish I could remember her name 
I wish I could remember his name 
I wish I could understand French 
I wish I had been there with you 
I wish he would write more often 
I wish that I could speak French 
I wish that you wouldn't do that 
I wish you could've come with us 
I wish you were here with me now 
I wish you wouldn't call me that 
I wish you'd stop calling me Tom 
I won't ask you for help anymore 
I won't be able to sleep tonight 
I won't do it anymore  I promise 
I won't tell anyone if you won't 
I wonder if Tom has a girlfriend 
I wonder if Tom is still outside 
I wonder if Tom is still wealthy 
I wonder if Tom still likes Mary 
I wonder if that's even possible 
I wonder if there's a connection 
I wonder what Tom is reading now 
I wonder where Tom could've gone 
I wonder whether Tom is homesick 
I wonder why Tom came here today 
I wonder why Tom doesn't like me 
I wonder why Tom is so depressed 
I wonder why Tom left that there 
I wonder why Tom was disobedient 
I wonder why my computer crashed 
I work every day except Saturday 
I work hard at a hotel every day 
I work on the other side of town 
I would like a week off with pay 
I would like to buy some aspirin 
I would like to come and see you 
I would like to have this camera 
I would like you to come with me 
I would never lend Tom any money 
I would rather not talk about it 
I wouldn't be so sure about that 
I wouldn't do that if I were you 
I wouldn't have said it that way 
I wouldn't mind a beer right now 
I wouldn't want anyone to see us 
I write letters almost every day 
I wrote a love letter last night 
I wrote three letters last night 
I'd be delighted to sing for you 
I'd decided not to do that again 
I'd like a cup of coffee, please 
I'd like a room with a good view 
I'd like an 80-yen stamp, please 
I'd like some more bread, please 
I'd like three pounds of chicken 
I'd like to get a second opinion 
I'd like to go to Hawaii as well 
I'd like to graduate next spring 
I'd like to have a glass of wine 
I'd like to have a word with you 
I'd like to have dinner with you 
I'd like to have my hair trimmed 
I'd like to hear that song again 
I'd like to invite you to dinner 
I'd like to know what's going on 
I'd like to know where Tom lives 
I'd like to know why you're here 
I'd like to live near your house 
I'd like to make a call to Japan 
I'd like to play tennis with you 
I'd like to run a big stock farm 
I'd like to speak to Tom Jackson 
I'd like to speak with Tom alone 
I'd like to stay a little longer 
I'd like to try horseback riding 
I'd like you to apologize to Tom 
I'd like you to drop the charges 
I'd never do something like that 
I'd rather be a bird than a fish 
I'd rather drink coffee than tea 
I'd rather take a taxi than walk 
I'd suggest the following change 
I'll arrive on October twentieth 
I'll be at home all day tomorrow 
I'll be back in a couple minutes 
I'll be lonely after you've gone 
I'll be there in fifteen minutes 
I'll be working all day tomorrow 
I'll call back in twenty minutes 
I'll call you if I hear anything 
I'll come back tomorrow if I can 
I'll deliver it as soon as I can 
I'll discuss the matter with Tom 
I'll eat my hat if Tom does that 
I'll go even if it rains heavily 
I'll have something for you soon 
I'll hire whoever Tom recommends 
I'll keep the menu as a souvenir 
I'll let you know in a day or so 
I'll let you know when it's done 
I'll make an exception this time 
I'll never be able to play again 
I'll never go out with Tom again 
I'll never leave you alone again 
I'll not make that mistake again 
I'll see you on Monday in Boston 
I'll set out for China next week 
I'll stay here till you get back 
I'll stay there till six o'clock 
I'll take back everything I said 
I'll teach you how to play chess 
I'll walk you back to your hotel 
I'm afraid I can't tell you that 
I'm afraid that you're in danger 
I'm afraid we can't go on Monday 
I'm always busy with my homework 
I'm beginning to see the picture 
I'm cold  May I close the window?
I'm convinced my son is innocent 
I'm downloading the pictures now 
I'm fed up with this wet weather 
I'm getting off at the next stop 
I'm getting used to eating alone 
I'm glad I didn't live back then 
I'm glad Tom is going to help us 
I'm glad to hear of your success 
I'm glad to see you in one piece 
I'm glad you asked me for advice 
I'm glad you guys are still here 
I'm going to Boston this weekend 
I'm going to chop this tree down 
I'm going to cook dinner tonight 
I'm going to do you a huge favor 
I'm going to have to dye my hair 
I'm going to send Tom some money 
I'm going to take a quick shower 
I'm going to tell you everything 
I'm half an inch taller than Tom 
I'm happy to be able to help you 
I'm in trouble  I need your help 
I'm just trying to be neighborly 
I'm just trying to buy some time 
I'm looking for a place to sleep 
I'm looking forward to Christmas 
I'm looking forward to the party 
I'm no slouch on the dance floor 
I'm not able to fix the computer 
I'm not afraid of snakes anymore 
I'm not allowed to drink alcohol 
I'm not doing this for the money 
I'm not going to do that anymore 
I'm not hiding anything from you 
I'm not in love with Tom anymore 
I'm not interested in modern art 
I'm not privy to their decisions 
I'm not ready for a relationship 
I'm not sure I can swim that far 
I'm not sure I feel the same way 
I'm not sure if Tom will do that 
I'm not taking Tom's word for it 
I'm not trying to impress anyone 
I'm not used to getting up early 
I'm old enough to be your father 
I'm old enough to live by myself 
I'm old enough to support myself 
I'm only interested in the truth 
I'm playing the devil's advocate 
I'm pleasantly surprised by that 
I'm practically already an adult 
I'm practically already grown up 
I'm practically an adult already 
I'm pretty sure Tom lied to Mary 
I'm really fed up with this heat 
I'm really looking forward to it 
I'm responsible for Tom's safety 
I'm satisfied with these results 
I'm sick and tired of hamburgers 
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot 
I'm sorry it worked out this way 
I'm sorry that you can't join us 
I'm sorry to trouble you so much 
I'm sorry, I just wanted to help 
I'm sorry, but I have to go home 
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I'm sorry, today is fully booked 
I'm starting to lose my patience 
I'm sticking to my original plan 
I'm still suffering from jet lag 
I'm sure I have the right number 
I'm sure I saw her two years ago 
I'm sure I'll be able to find it 
I'm sure Tom intended to do that 
I'm sure Tom will come back soon 
I'm sure Tom would appreciate it 
I'm sure that wasn't intentional 
I'm sure there's another way out 
I'm sure we have a lot in common 
I'm sure you'll have enough time 
I'm taking Tom to Boston with me 
I'm the one who should apologize 
I'm the only one who can do that 
I'm the owner of this restaurant 
I'm the tallest one in the class 
I'm three inches taller than you 
I'm three years younger than you 
I'm tired of all this rigamarole 
I'm tired  I'm going to lie down 
I'm too tired to walk any longer 
I'm trying to memorize my speech 
I'm two years younger than he is 
I'm very pleased to have met you 
I'm very worried about my weight 
I'm waiting for a telephone call 
I'm waiting for her to come here 
I'm willing to accept your offer 
I've all but finished doing that 
I've already been here two hours 
I've already signed the contract 
I've already told Tom all I know 
I've been asked to do that again 
I've been busy since last Monday 
I've been given a death sentence 
I've been short of breath lately 
I've been silent for a long time 
I've been sober for eight months 
I've been swimming all afternoon 
I've been to Boston often enough 
I've been told that often enough 
I've been wanting to talk to you 
I've been worried sick about you 
I've changed my website's layout 
I've come to know Tom quite well 
I've done that a number of times 
I've done that quite a few times 
I've finished writing the letter 
I've given this a lot of thought 
I've given you my answer already 
I've got a bone to pick with Tom 
I've got a few questions for you 
I've got a lot of thinking to do 
I've got a surprise for you, Tom 
I've got as much money as he has 
I've got more money than Tom has 
I've got something you both need 
I've got to go to the men's room 
I've got to learn some new songs 
I've got to prepare for the test 
I've got to shave before leaving 
I've heard a lot about that, too 
I've heard good things about you 
I've heard quite a lot about you 
I've just arrived at the airport 
I've just arrived at the station 
I've just flown back from Boston 
I've lived here for thirty years 
I've never been on my own before 
I've never been this busy before 
I've never had to work very hard 
I've never heard of such a thing 
I've never seen Tom drunk before 
I've never seen a whale that big 
I've never seen anything like it 
I've packed my suitcases already 
I've saved you a seat next to me 
I've thanked Tom for the present 
I've told you not to call me Tom 
I've traveled all over Australia 
I've waited for more than a week 
I've worked with Tom a long time 
If I knew anything, I'd tell you 
If I were you, I would trust her 
If I were you, I'd paint it blue 
If Tom comes, please let me know 
If Tom goes to Boston, so will I 
If anybody calls, get his number 
If anybody can help us, it's Tom 
If anyone can fix this, it's Tom 
If anything happens, let me know 
If he saw you, he'd be surprised 
If it is worth doing, do it well 
If it isn't broken, don't fix it 
If it rains tomorrow, I won't go 
If it were up to me, I'd say yes 
If it were up to us, we'd say no 
If only I had known this earlier 
If only I'd been a little taller!
If possible, I'd like to see him 
If you are busy, I will help you 
If you are wrong, I am wrong too 
If you don't ask her out, I will 
If you don't believe me, ask Tom 
If you don't go, I won't, either 
If you need help, I can help you 
Illness kept me from going there 
In Australia, they speak English 
In Japan, school starts in April 
In autumn the leaves turn yellow 
In case of fire, push the button 
In school, Tom was often bullied 
In spite of the rain, I went out 
In the alphabet, B comes after A 
Instead of fretting, take action 
Is Tom studying French at school?
Is Tom the one who told you that?
Is eating healthy more expensive?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Is he coming home at six o'clock?
Is he taller than his brother is?
Is it OK if I change the channel?
Is it OK if I take a look around?
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
Is it possible that you're wrong?
Is it safe to swim in this river?
Is something the matter with Tom?
Is that the train I have to take?
Is that your car in the driveway?
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
Is there a bank near the station?
Is there a flight in the morning?
Is there a gas station near here?
Is there a golf course near here?
Is there a supermarket near here?
Is there any danger of radiation?
Is there any food you don't like?
Is there any truth to that rumor?
Is there anything wrong with you?
Is there anywhere you want to go?
Is there something that you want?
Is this ticket good for this bus?
Is this your first investigation?
Is this your first time in Korea?
Is this your idea of a good time?
Isn't it true that you own a gun?
Isn't that how competition works?
Isn't that what Tom said to Mary?
It appears to me you're mistaken 
It doesn't bother me if you stay 
It doesn't have to end like that 
It doesn't look like you're sick 
It gets quite cold in the winter 
It hardly ever rains in the area 
It has been raining for two days 
It has been raining since Sunday 
It is Paris that I want to visit 
It is a little late for that now 
It is cold there, even in summer 
It is dangerous to drive so fast 
It is expensive to live in Japan 
It is impossible for me to do so 
It is interesting to play soccer 
It is no use asking for her help 
It is no use asking me for money 
It is obvious that that is a lie 
It is said that he was very rich 
It is still in the testing stage 
It is ten degrees below zero now 
It is two o'clock in the morning 
It is unbearably hot this summer 
It is worth visiting that museum 
It isn't death I fear, but dying 
It isn't worth worrying about it 
It just was not my day yesterday 
It looked like Tom was disgusted 
It looks like Tom is unconvinced 
It looks like it's going to rain 
It looks like it's going to snow 
It looks like we have everything 
It looks like you're on your own 
It must have been a shock to you 
It only took about three minutes 
It probably wouldn't have helped 
It rained heavily in the morning 
It requires skill and dedication 
It seems obvious that he is sick 
It seems that the news was false 
It seems that we've lost our way 
It seems to me that he is honest 
It seems to me that you're wrong 
It seems we are in the same boat 
It snowed a good deal last night 
It sounds like someone is crying 
It sounds like you're having fun 
It took little more than an hour 
It turned out to be a lovely day 
It was a one hundred dollar bill 
It was a simple misunderstanding 
It was cloudy all day long today 
It was dark and cold in the room 
It was less than fifteen dollars 
It was nothing but a coincidence 
It was obvious that he was lying 
It was that dog that bit my hand 
It was the best night of my life 
It was the calm before the storm 
It was very cold, but I went out 
It was very dark inside the mine 
It was very dark inside the room 
It was you that made the mistake!
It will stop raining before long 
It won't happen again, I promise 
It would be smart not to do that 
It would break if you dropped it 
It would only be a waste of time 
It would probably be a good idea 
It wouldn't have mattered anyway 
It'll be easy for you to do that 
It'll cost at least five dollars 
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
It's a good thing Tom isn't here 
It's a great way to make friends 
It's a lot easier than I thought 
It's a lot of fun going on trips 
It's a lot of fun to be with you 
It's a pleasure to meet you, Tom 
It's about time I was going home 
It's about time for you to leave 
It's already time to go to sleep 
It's an unforgettable impression 
It's as much an art as a science 
It's been ages since we last met 
It's dangerous to go there alone 
It's dangerous to play with fire 
It's definitely starting to rain 
It's difficult to peel chestnuts 
It's doubtful if Tom can do that 
It's easy to make and it's cheap 
It's essential that we find them 
It's evident that you told a lie 
It's going to be another hot day 
It's going to take about an hour 
It's illegal to waste water here 
It's impolite to stare at people 
It's just a friendly competition 
It's just the tip of the iceberg 
It's my responsibility, isn't it?
It's nice to see a familiar face 
It's not clear when he came here 
It's not death I fear, but dying 
It's not easy to thread a needle 
It's not quite as simple as that 
It's not something anyone can do 
It's obvious that you told a lie 
It's pitch black in the basement 
It's pitch black inside the cave 
It's quite unlikely Tom will win 
It's really not worth the effort 
It's really very easy to do that 
It's time for me to be on my way 
It's time for your afternoon nap 
It's too dark to play tennis now 
It's very kind of you to help me 
It's very nice of you to help me 
It's your duty to finish the job 
Just give us a couple of minutes 
Just keep your mind on your work 
Just put those packages anywhere 
Karate is a Japanese martial art 
Keep quiet  The baby is sleeping 
Kenya became independent in 1963 
Last night, I heard dogs howling 
Let Tom know we've got a problem 
Let me ask you a simple question 
Let me finish eating my sandwich 
Let me give you a word of advice 
Let me have another look at that 
Let me know if you need anything 
Let me know when you'll be ready 
Let me know when you've finished 
Let me take a look at your tires 
Let us know whether you can come 
Let us never speak of this again 
Let's discuss that problem later 
Let's forget the whole thing, OK?
Let's get this meeting over with 
Let's get this over with quickly 
Let's go before things get worse 
Let's go to the theater together 
Let's meet in front of the hotel 
Let's not let things get us down 
Let's not talk about it any more 
Let's play baseball after school 
Let's pretend this didn't happen 
Let's see what Tom can do for us 
Let's shake hands and be friends 
Let's take an X-ray just in case 
Let's take it one step at a time 
Let's talk about it after school 
Let's talk about why you're here 
Let's wait and see what Tom says 
Let's wait for another 5 minutes

Life is like a box of chocolates

May I ask what you're working on?
May I have a look at your ticket?
May I have another piece of cake?
May I make a suggestion about it?
May I see your birth certificate?
May I see your invitation please?
Maybe I'll go, and maybe I won't 
Maybe Tom is too busy to help us 
Maybe you don't want to remember

Wise Birds and Foolish Birds
Once upon a time
there was a giant tree in the forest
Many, many birds lived in this tree
And the wisest of them was their leader 
One day, the leader saw two branches rubbing against each other
“There is no doubt a fire is going to start
One that may burn down the whole forest
he thought 
The wise old leader called for a meeting with all the birds living in the great tree
My dear friends
he said  “The tree we are living in is beginning to produce a fire
This fire may destroy the whole forest
Therefore it is dangerous to stay here
We must leave this forest at once!”
The wise birds agreed to follow his advice 
They flew away to another forest in a different land
But the foolhardy ones said:
“That old leader panics so easily 
He imagines crocodiles in a drop of water!
Why should we leave our comfortable homes that have always been safe?
Let the timid ones go 
We will be brave and place trust in our trees!”
Lo and behold, in a little while,
the wise leader’s warning came true 
The rubbing branches made sparks that fell onto some dried leaves under the tree 
Those sparks became flames and soon a forest fire raged madly
The giant tree caught fire too 
The foolish birds that stayed behind were blinded and choked by the smoke 
Not able to escape, many were trapped and burned to death 
The moral : Those who ignore the advice of the wise, do so at their own risk 
2 The Ox who envied the pig
Once, a farmer had two big and strong oxen by the names of Big Red and Little Red on his farm 
He also owned a little pig that used to live with the oxen 
The oxen used to work very hard in the farmer’s field 
The pig did nothing and just idled around 
One day,
the farmer fixed his daughter’s wedding 
He ordered his men to fatten the pig for the wedding feast 
And since that day,
the farmer’s men started feeding a rich diet to the pig 
Seeing this,
Little Red said to Big Red,
“Brother, just look at the good fortune of this lazy pig!
He is getting to eat all the delicious dishes without doing anything
Despite working so hard in the fields, we get to eat only some straws and grass ”
Big Red replied,
“Dear brother,
do not envy the pig 
He is eating the food of death 
He is being fattened up for the wedding feast 
He would soon be slaughtered by the farmer 
a young crab and his mother were on the beach,
spending some time together 
The young crab gets up to move,
but it can only walk sideways 
His mother scolds him for walking sideways and asks him to walk forward by pointing his toes out front 
The young crab responds,
“I would like to walk forward mom,
but I do not know how to” 
Hearing this,
his mom gets up to show him how,
but even she is unable to bend her knees forward 
She realizes that she was being unfair,
apologizes sheepishly,
Moral:Don’t condemn someone for not doing something that you yourself are unable to do 
and sits back in the sand 
The Dog At The Well
A dog and her pups lived on a farm,
where there was a well 
The mother dog told the pups,
do not go near the well or play around it 
One of the pups wondered why they shouldn’t go to the well and decided to explore it 
He went to the well 
Climbed up the wall and peeked inside 
In there,
he saw his reflection and thought it was another dog 
The pup saw that the other dog in the well (his reflection) was doing whatever he was doing,
and got angry for imitating him
He decided to fight with the dog and jumped into the well,
only to find no dog there 
He barked and barked and swam until the farmer came and rescued him
The pup had learned his lesson 
Moral:Always listen to what the elders say  Question them, but do not defy them 
The Man And The Cat
One day,
a man was walking by a road when he heard a cat meowing from the bushes nearby 
The cat was stuck and needed help getting out 
When the man reached out,
the cat got scared and scratched the man 
The man screamed in pain but didn’t back down 
He tried again and again,
even as the cat continued to scratch his hands 
Another passerby saw this and said,
“Just let it be!
The cat will find a way to come out later” 
The man didn’t pay heed but tried until he helped the cat 
Once he let the cat free,
he told the other man,
“The cat is an animal,
and its instincts make him scratch and attack 
I am a human and my instincts make me compassionate and kind” 
Moral:Treat everyone around you like you want to be treated  Adhere to your own rules or ethics, not theirs 
Good Company, Bad Company
Two parrots built a nest in a banyan tree 
They lived with their two young ones,
which they took good care of 
The mother and the father parrot went out to gather food in the morning and came back home by evening 
One day,
when their parents were away,
the young parrots were taken by a cruel hunter 
One of the birds managed to escape and flew away from the hunter 
He ended up at a hermitage and grew up listening to kind words and compassion 
The hunter put the other parrot in a cage,
and soon it learned a few words and phrases 
The hunter and his family were crude and didn’t care much about kind words 
One day,
a passerby was resting outside the hunter’s hut 
Sensing someone outside,
the parrot said,
“Fool,
why are you here? Fool! Leave!
I’ll cut your throat” 
Scared,
the traveler went away,
and on his journey,
he reached the hermitage where the other parrot was 
The parrot at the hermitage spoke,
“Welcome traveler 
You are free to stay here as long as you want” 
Surprised,
the traveler told the parrot that he encountered a similar parrot elsewhere and it was very cruel 
How is that you are so kind?”
The parrot replied,
“That must be my brother 
I live with the sages,
and my brother lives with hunters 
I learned the sage’s language,
and my brother learned the hunter’s language 
The company we keep decides who we will be” 
Moral:Keep good company if you want to be a good person 
An Old Man Lived in the Village
An old man lived in the village 
He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world 
The whole village was tired of him 
he was always gloomy,
he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood 
The longer he lived,
the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words 
People avoided him,
because his misfortune became contagious 
It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him 
He created the feeling of unhappiness in others 
But one day,
when he turned eighty years old,
an incredible thing happened 
Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:
“An Old Man is happy today,
he doesn’t complain about anything, smiles,
and even his face is freshened up ”
The whole village gathered together 
The old man was asked:
Villager: What happened to you?
“Nothing special 
Eighty years I’ve been chasing happiness,
and it was useless 
And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life 
That’s why I’m happy now ”
An Old Man
Moral:Don’t chase happiness  Enjoy your life

but without saying anything,
wrote in the sand 
“Today my best friend slapped me in the face ”
They kept on walking until they found an oasis,
they aggred to take bath 
The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning,
but the friend saved him 
After he recovered from the near drowning,
he wrote on a stone 
“Today my best friend saved my life ”
The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him 
After I hurt you,
you wrote in the sand and now,
you write on a stone, why?”
The other friend replied 
“When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away 
But,
when someone does something good for us,
we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it ”
Moral:Don’t value the things you have in your life  But value who you have in your life 
The Greedy Lion

and a lion was feeling very hungry 
He came out of his den and searched here and there 
He could find only a small hare 
He caught the hare with some hesitation 
“This hare can’t fill my stomach”
thought the lion 
As the lion was about to kill the hare,
a deer ran that way 
The lion became greedy 
He thought 
“Instead of eating this small hare,
let me eat the big deer ”
He let the hare go and went behind the deer 
But the deer had vanished into the forest 
The lion now felt sorry for letting the hare off 
Moral:A bird in hand is worth two in the bush 
Two Friends & The Bear
Vijay and Raju were friends 
On a holiday they went walking into a forest,
enjoying the beauty of nature 
Suddenly they saw a bear coming at them 
They became frightened 
Raju,
who knew all about climbing trees,
ran up to a tree and climbed up quickly
He didn’t think of Vijay 
Vijay had no idea how to climb the tree 
Vijay thought for a second 
He’d heard animals don’t prefer dead bodies,
so he fell to the ground and held his breath 
The bear sniffed him and thought he was dead 
So, it went on its way 
Raju asked Vijay 
“What did the bear whisper into your ears?”
Vijay replied,
“The bear asked me to keep away from friends like you”
and went on his way 
Moral:A friend in need is a friend indeed

Some days later,
the slave’s master comes hunting to the forest and catches many animals and cages them

The master asks for the slave to be thrown into the lion’s cage 
The slave is awaiting his death in the cage when he realizes that it is the same lion that he had helped 
The slave rescued the lion and all other caged animals 
Moral :One should help others in need, we get the rewards of our helpful acts in return 
The Fox & The Grapes
One afternoon a fox was walking through the forest and spotted a bunch of grapes hanging from over a lofty branch

Taking a few steps back,
he fox jumped and just missed the hanging grapes 
Again the fox took a few paces back and tried to reach them but still failed 
Finally,
giving up,
the fox turned up his nose and said,
They’re probably sour anyway,”
and proceeded to walk away 
Moral:It’s easy to despise what you can’t have 
Be Good To Your Enemies
Long ago,
there lived a little boy named Sammy 
He was a good boy  He was good in his studies,
obedient to his parents,
more intelligent than many other boys in his class and kind to everyone 
Grown-ups as well as those junior to Sammy loved him very much 
But that aroused jealousy in many other boys who longed to be as loved as Sammy 
Now there was another boy named Timmy who studied in the same class as Sammy 
Unlike Sammy,
he was not good at studies and always liked to play during school hours 
He misbehaved with his parents,
bullied his classmates and even ill-treated Sammy 
He always tried to put Sammy down and belittled him before other kids in the class 
But no matter what he did,
Sammy's grades kept getting better and better 
Whether in studies or in sports or from his classmates,
Sammy kept getting accolades from everywhere 
On his eighth birthday,
Sammy got a nice pen as a gift from his parents 
He brought it to school so that he could use it to take down the notes of the lectures that the teachers gave in class 
This was a very beautiful pen and it could help one write very fast 
When Timmy saw it,
he was very jealous of Sammy 
He asked Sammy,
 Hey, where did you get that? Did you buy it? 
 My parents gave it as a birthday gift to me  
replied Sammy 
Timmy was overwhelmed with anger and jealousy 
The bad boy that he was,
he rarely got any present from his parents 
He decided to steal Sammy's pen 
During recess,
when everyone had gone out from the class, 
Timmy opened Sammy's bag and took out his pen 
Then he hid it inside his bag and went out to have his tiffin  
When Sammy came back and could not find his pen,
he informed his class teacher about it 
There was a hunt for the missing pen and the class teacher ordered the class monitor to search the bag of every children inside the class 
The missing pen was soon found out of Timmy's bag and the furious teacher asked the errant boy,
 Now Timmy, what do you have to say about it? 
Timmy was in tears  He had nothing to say  
When Sammy saw Timmy cry,
he took pity on the boy 
The kind boy that he was,
he had no ill-feeling against his classmate 
He requested his class teacher not to take any action against Timmy,
now that his stolen pen was found 
This opened Timmy's eyes 
He could now see what a good boy Sammy was 
He asked for forgiveness from his teacher and Sammy 
From that day,
he became friends with Sammy and gradually changed himself to be as good as Sammy 
Everyone began to love Timmy and Sammy was proud of his new friend  
Despite being hurt by Timmy,
Sammy gave him back only love in return 
This is how we should also treat our enemies 
Who knows? 
One day,
our behaviour may just change themselves for the better 
Moral: Do not harm someone even if he harms you  Be good to all 
Be Good To Your Enemies
Once upon a time,
there lived a farmer who had a little land 
His name was Tuan and he was a very kind and good-natured person 
He lived in a hut on his land with his wife and children and earned by selling whatever crops he could produce on his small land 
Tuan loved to help others 
Whenever someone fell ill or needed something badly,
Tuan was there to help that person 
If someone died in the village,
Tuan assisted the family members of the deceased person in whichever way he could 
If anyone fell ill at night,
Tuan was right beside the village doctor to help him prepare the medicines and tend to the sick 
There seemed to be none who hated this man 
He appeared to be loved by one and all 
But there was one person who hated Tuan with all his heart 
He was Juan,
a neighbour of Tuan,
who lived in the land next to him 
A lazy person by nature,
Juan hardly put in as much effort to cultivate his land as Tuan did to produce crops in his own 
So when the harvest season arrived every year,
Juan found that he had very few crops to sell 
Tuan on the other hand,
earned a handsome profit through the selling of his produces  
One year,
Juan could no longer contain his jealousy 
Just days before Tuan was to reap his harvest, 
Juan set fire to his crops at night 
Tuan was asleep at this time and it was only the alertness of one of his other neighbours that saved much of his crops from being perished in the deadly flames of the fire that Juan had lighted  
When the flames were doused,
Tuan saw which direction the fire had started from 
Juan's animosity towards him was unknown to Tuan 
But he let the matters rest and decided to take action only if he saw Juan repeating his dastardly act once again  
That year,
Tuan managed to sell the rest of his crops at a good price but he could not make much profit for a good part of his produces had been burnt 
He had a heavy heart but he did not like to tell anyone about it  
Only days later,
Tuan was awakened by the sound of lamentations 
He went out to find a crowd beside Juan's hut 
He rushed to find that Juan's son had fallen ill 
He found that the village doctor was unable to provide a cure to his illness 
Juan knew what he had to do 
He untied his own horse and rode it 
Then he rushed to the town that was ten miles away and fetched a more experienced doctor who lived there  
This doctor was able to guess the disease correctly and provided an exact cure for it 
Within hours,
the boy was found to sleep soundly and Tuan went with the doctor to take him back to the town 
A day later,
Juan went to Tuan's hut and began to weep bitterly 
He confessed to his sins but was surprised when Tuan told him that he knew about it all  
 You knew that I had set fire to your crops?
And still you fetched the doctor for my son? 
asked the astonished Juan 
Tuan nodded and said,
I did what I knew was right 
could I do wrong just because you had done so?  
Juan stood up and embraced Tuan 
Both men were in tears and so were the others who stood by them 
From that day,
Juan changed himself 
Within a year,
he could produce much crops in his land through his hard work 
When the others asked him how he had changed so much,
he only replied,
 It was the goodness and love of Tuan that transformed me  
Moral: Be nice to your friends  Be nicer to your enemies 
Be Good To Your Enemies
Many many years ago,
there lived a dog named Tom 
Tom was adopted as a pet in a wealthy household and he was daily showered with nice foods and affections by her mistress Mrs Havisham 
All day,
Tom lived in a kennel within the compound of the house and he tried his best to guard the home of his mistress 
Whenever a thief or a burgler came within the vicinity,
Tom would bark as loudly as he could to scare the living daylights out of the culprit 
He was the favourite of his mistress 
When night fell,
he slept on a nice blanket inside his kennel and when day broke he had his food served before him in no time  
But the neighbourhood dogs were not so lucky and they were jealous of Tom's fortune 
Now and then, 
they would bark from outside the gates of Tom's house and utter curses at him 
All this disturbed Tom a little,
but he would only say,
 Poor fellows,
they have to struggle so much for their food while I am so lucky 
I must not shout at them and add to their misery   
So he kept quiet and went about his business,
turning a deaf ear to their insults  
One day,
as he was taking a walk with his mistress,
Tom found that some young boys were throwing stones at those same dogs who insulted him 
The dogs were cornered and they had nowhere to go  
They could in no way avoid being hit by the stones thrown at them 
Many of them were bleeding and barking feebly in protest 
But the boys were not in a mood to let go of them so lightly 
They picked up bigger stones and rocks to have more fun at the expense of the weak,
helpless dogs 
Tom could not hold himself back 
He was of a strong build and had a very deep voice 
He knew that he could scare the boys 
He managed to wrench his leash free out of his mistress' hands and he ran towards the boys  
he boys were startled at the terrible barking that Tom directed at them 
Their blood froze at the sight of the huge Tom baring his fangs and running towards them 
They dropped their rocks and ran away as fast as their legs could carry them 
 Go home 
Tom said to his bloodied abusers
 no one will disturb you anymore   
He ran back to his mistress who had seen all that Tom did 
She patted Tom and praised him for his courage  
That night,
Tom's mistress saw a strange sight 
The dogs whom Tom had saved in the morning had gathered near the gates of her house 
It seemed to her as if they were telling something to her pet  
 Maybe they are thanking Tom for his brave gesture   
she thought 
And right she was!
From that day,
Tom and his abusers had become friends 
Tom's kindness had won over his abusers' hatred and he had earned their love,
respect and admiration that nothing on earth could buy 
Moral: Be good to all, even if they happen to be your enemies 
The Sad Peacock
Once a beautiful peacock who was all,
but dancing on a rainy day 
While he was busy admiring his plumage,
his rough voice reminded him of his own shortcomings 
All the joy beaten out of him,
he was almost in tears 
Suddenly,
he heard a nightingale singing nearby 
Listening to the nightingale’s sweet voice
his own shortcoming once again became very evident 
He began wondering why he was jinxed in such a manner 
At that moment,
Juno,
the leader of the Gods,
appeared and addressed the peacock 
“Why are you upset?”
Juno asked the peacock 
The peacock complained about his rough voice and how he was sad because of it 
“The nightingale has such a beautiful voice 
Why don’t I?”
After listening to the peacock,
Juno explained,
“ every living being is special in his or her own way 
They are and made in a certain manner that serves the greater purpose 
Yes, the nightingale is blessed with a beautiful voice,
but you are also blessed
with such a beautiful and glittering plumage!
The trick is acceptance and making the most of what you have ”
The peacock understood how silly he had been in comparing himself to others and forgetting his own blessings 
 He realised that day,
that everyone was unique in some way or the other 
Moral:
Self-acceptance is the first step to happiness 
Make the best of what you have,
rather than being unhappy about what you don’t 
The Three Fish
There were three fish living in a pond 
They were friends and practically did everything together 
One day,
a fisherman came across the pond and was delighted to see the fish 
He made plans to cast a net and catch them   
The wisest of the fishes made plans to find a different pond 
While one of the fish agreed,
the other one denied,
saying that the pond was home and he shall not vacate it 
The third fish further said that there had never been any danger in the pond 
“I don’t see the point of leaving this pond 
I think it is cowardly ”
The first two fish were unable to convince their friend,
and so they decided to part ways 
The next day,
when the fishermen cast his net,
the first two fish escaped 
However,
the third one got caught 
and was now paying the price of neglecting danger 
Moral:
It pays to be wise when faced with a problem 
Remember that every problem is different
and therefore, has a different solution 
The Son of The Lioness
Once upon a time there was a tremendous fuss and quarrel among all the animals 
They were arguing hotly about who had the finest children!
Everyone of them from the frogs and the caterpillars to the rabbits and the rats declared that no families had ever been born like their families and that it was a great pity their children and grandchildren and great grandchildren were not numerous enough to fill the whole world 
Anyway,
they said,
they would go on doing their best 
The caterpillars and frogs would lay eggs by the hundred 
The rabbits would make new warrens and the rats would take possession of ever so many more drains 
Then, surely, it would be agreed that a caterpillar,
or a frog, a rat, or a rabbit,
had the glory of giving to the world the finest children that had ever been born in it 
They all agreed about one thing,
in spite of the arguing,
they would wait just one year
then they would go to King Jupiter on his mountain
ask him to settle the matter for them 
So, for a year, they laid their dispute aside 
At the end of it,
they sent a message to the king of the mountain,
they would like to have the privilege of calling upon him and would bring all their families along with them 
King Jupiter sat on his shining throne and up the sides of the mountain came the long strings of animals 
Mount Olympus had seen some strange sights,
but perhaps this procession was the oddest of all 
First came Father and Mother Hedgehog 
Very squat they were
They were followed by seven little hedgehogs just as prickly just as brown and just as squat 
When they saw King Jupiter,
they were all so startled that they rolled themselves up into balls and lay quite still in front of him 
But even in this rather ridiculous position 
Mother Hedgehog might be heard murmuring from the middle of her stiffened spines,
many things about the beauty and number of her children 
The hedgehogs had to make way,
however,
for a much larger party - a whole family of lizards 
Together with Father Lizard and Mother Lizard,
there were twelve little misses and masters of the same name 
They were smooth yellowish little creatures with quick legs and tails that flicked about like whips 
They darted all over the top of the mountain,
catching flies and no doubt amused King Jupiter very much 
But they,
too, had to move aside to allow him to give an opinion upon a colony of frogs 
If numbers were to win the prize of excellence,
surely the frogs had it!
The Father and the Mother, solemn, goggle-eyed and fat,
were followed by at least a hundred of the sizes of a thumb,
just like themselves 
They had all come straight out of a shallow pond in a heavy shower that very morning,
scrambling through the wet grass and hopping along the turnpike road
such that the country folks thought they had fallen out of the clouds together with the rain
They were only skipping along after their Father and Mother to hear what King Jupiter had to say about them  
But they hadn’t done any such thing!
So it went on all through that strange and wonderful day on Mount Olympus 
The caterpillars came,
the rats came…the rabbits came 
And all of them brought a regular tribe of children,
none of them a year old 
Then up trotted the foxes and the badgers the weasels and the stoats each with four or five youngsters apiece 
But at last,
up the hill path,
came a lioness
beautiful and strong 
And she had only one child,
a little creature with golden eyes and splendid limbs 
She led him up to Jupiter and sitting on her haunches,
surveyed her glorious child in silence 
Then King Jupiter came down from his bright throne and holding up his mace gave his decision in a clear and ringing voice 
 Listen, you Fathers and Mothers of rabbits,
hedgehogs and frogs!
It is true that you have all produced a great many children in the past year and that the lioness has produced only one 
But that one is a Lion!
To the lioness, therefore, I give the prize 
Her child shall, from now be called Royal 
I name him, from today, the king of all the beasts  
He touched the little lion’s head for a moment with his hand 
Then the lioness turned away still in silence and led her son back to her cave at the foot of the mountain 
She had taken no part in the boasting of the lesser animals,
yet she had always known that her son was the finest creature ever given to the world 
She had only one child
but as Jupiter had said,
that only child was a Lion 
Moral: It is not the quantity but the quality that matters  
25 Look before You leap 
Once, a fox was very thirsty 
He saw a big well nearby and peeped into it 
The fox slipped and fell into the well 
He tried to come out 
But he could not do so 
After some time,
there came a goat who was also thirsty 
He too peeped into the well 
The fox saw the goat and said from inside the well,
“The water is very sweet 
Come and Come to enjoy  
The foolish goat also jumped into the well 
The clever fox climbed on the back of the goat and jumped out of the well

we know how to move about in water and our wit will save us  
 mere words do not scare us and we will stay here, 
They added 
The frog did not like the casual attitude of his friends 
He thought to himself,
 How will they be able to escape from the fishermen's net 
The frog decided to save his own life 
he found himself a place where he thought he would be safe 
He decided to hide under the weeds that grew by the lakeside 
The next day the fishermen actually came 
They threw the fishing net into the water,
while the frog watched from his hideout 
He began worrying about his friends in the lake 
The fishermen waited a while,
silently without disturbing the net 
Finally the fishermen took out the net 
It was full of fish and the frig also saw his friends crying for help 
But it was too late 
The frog felt very sad but could do nothing to help them 
He helplessly looked at the fishermen carrying his friends away 
Sitting alone by the lakeside,

 Only if my friends had not been foolish to rule out my advice and taken my warning more seriously,
They would have been safe with me today

and shouted,
 Help! Help! A wolf is eating my sheep 
Please come fast 
 He shouted his lungs out as he was desparate for help 
The farmers heard the shepherd boy's scream,
but this time they just looked once in the direction from where the voice was coming and said,
 He cannot fool us again

 Son, I have warned you earlier 
If you do not fooled the farmers before,
they would have believed you today and rescued your sheep  
The shepherd boy,
who had now learnt a lesson,
decided never to fool people again

a rabbit who was in search of a home found her empty nest 
The rabbit liked the bulbul nest a lot 
So he made it his home and started living here 
He was very happy and all the birds and animals around became hid friends 
When the bulbul came back,
she got very angry to find the rabbit living in her nest 
 Who are you?
why are you here? Fool! Leave!
This house belongs to me,
 shouted the bulbul 
 your house? 
said the rabbit in surprise 
 This house is mine now 
I have been living here since many days  
 How can you live here? 
asked the bulbul 
 This house was made by me and I had been living here 
If you wish,
you can ask the neighbours 
He insisted,
 I found this house empty,
so I moved in 
The house belongs to the one who lives in it and this house is mine now  
 No, this house belongs to me,
 cried the bulbul 
 I had gone for a few days to find some food 
Now that I have come back,
will you please give me my house back? 
 No, answered the rabbit ,
 I shall not give you your house back at any cost 
I shall stay here forever  
Both quarrelled for a long time 
Many animals and birds gathered around 
They listened to the bulbul and the rabbit 
But none of them could decide whether the house belonged to the rabbit or to the bulbul 
The animals decided that they must consult a judge to solve the dispute 
But finding a good judge was not going to be easy 
The rabbit and the bulbul walked for hours to find a good judge 
Finally,
they reached the other side of the jungle 
There, seated on the big rock,
was manu, the cat 
He was very wicked and dangerous too 
When Manu saw the rabbit and the bulbul coming,
he pretended to be praying with his eyes closed,
standing on one leg 
In his hand,
he held a string of prayer beads,
and he began to take God's name in a very loud voice so that the bulbul and the rabbit would hear him 
The rabbit and the bulbul were very much impressed on seeing Manu, the cat 
They found him humble and a devotee of God 
They decided to make him judge their dispute 
 But we must be very careful, 
sai the bulbul 
They waited till Manu finished the prayers 
 O holy sir,
a little dispute has taken place between me and the bulbul 
It is about an important matter of law 
Please adjudge who is right and who is wrongh and punish the guilty, 
said the rabbit  
 My friends,
never say such a wicked thing 
It hurts me when I see others in pain, 
said Manu 
 Those who harm others shall be punished by God 
Now please tell me what your quarrel is about  
 This is what happened,  said the bulbul 
 I had gone in search of food for a few days 
When I returned,
I found that this rabbit had moved into my house  
 No, it is my house because I have been staying here since many days now! 
exclaimed the rabbit 
 Please keep calm, both of you 
I have become very old 
I can neihter hear clearly nor see you well 
So will both of you please come closer to me and narrate the story again? 
The rabbit and the bulbul,
who were no longer afraid of Manu,
moved closer to him 
Instanly, the cunning cat pounced and killed both of them 
He then ate them up and satisfied his hunger 
A Wise Advance
Ramu and Shamu were good friends 
Both of them were woodcutters who stayed near the woods 
One day,
they went to the wood to cut trees 
Shamu began to boast about hid bravery and told Ramu,
 I am not afraid of wild animals 
I can kill them with one stroke of my sharp axe 
 Ramu heard this and said,
 That's very brave!
Iam proud to have a friend like you  
Suddenly, they saw a black bear coming towards them 
On seeing the bear Shamu got so scared that he ran and climed the nearest tree,
He thought,
 Now what should I do?
I have heard that bears never touch dead person 
I'll play dead and save my life  
The bear was approaching fast towards Ramu 
He quickly lay down on the ground pretending to be dead 
When the bear came near him,
Ramu held his breath and kept as still as a dead person 
The bear circled around him and smelt him 
Thinking that Ramu was dead,
the bear left and walked away into the woods 
After the bear went away,
Shamu came down from the tree 
He went and asked Ramu,
 Hey Ramu, I saw the bear wshiper something in your ears 
What did he say? 
Ramu answered,
 The bear indeed gave me a very wise advise 
He told me to never trust a friend who boast about himself,
for he shall leave you in the time of difficulty 
 Shamu was ashamedn of himself as he realized his mistake 
The Poor Brahmin
Once, there was a poor Brahmin who lived in a small town 
He was so poor that he never wore good clothes,
or indulged in the luxuary of eating 
He had matted hair,
an unshaven beard and uncut nails 
He was extremely weak and emaciated because he had no cover from cold,
sun or wind or rain 
Taking pity on him,
a rich man donated two calves to him 
With all care and love,
the Brahmin fed the calves well with butter oil and grass 
The calves grew into two fine and healthy animals 
One day,
a thief saw the calves and thought to himself,
 I must somehow steal and sell them 
They will bring me good money  
That night he set out for the Brahmin's house 
On the way,
he saw a lean but scary figure with dishevelled hair,
loose teeth as long and sharp as fangs,
an arched nose and blood-red eyes 
Though he was frighten,
the thief asked him,
 Who are you, sir? 
 I am a monster 
Who are you and where are you going at this late hour? 
The scared thief blured out the truth,
 I am a thief 
I am going to steal the calves of the Brahmin  
The monster trusted the words of the thief and said,
 I take only one meal a day in the evening and I will kill the Brahmin for my dinner  
Both of them went to the Brahmin's house 
the monster stepped in to kill the poor Brahmin 
The thief held him back saying,
 It is unjust to kill the Brahmin before I can take away the two calves  
The monster said,
 If the sound of the resisting calves distrubs the sleep of the Brahmin,
I will not be able to kill him  
The thief replied,
 Suppose you face some problem in killing him,
then I will not be able to take the calves 
Since I gave you the idea,
you should wait till I finish my job first  
The thief and the monster began quarrelling about who should be the first one to act 
The Brahmin woke up due to the commotion they were making and asked them who they were making and asked them who they were and what the matter was 
The thief pointed at the monster and said,
 O Brahmin, this monster wants to kill you and make you his meal  
The monster denied and said,
 O Brahmin, this thief wants to steal your calves  
The Brahmin quickly invoked his deity through prayer and the power of the prayer forced the monster to flee 
The Brahmin then took a stick and drove off the thief 
The Two Headed Weaver
Once upon a time,
there was a weaver by the name Mantharaka 
One day,
When he was weaving a cloth on his loom,
the wooden frames of his loom broke 
He took an axe and went to the forest to bring wood in order to make new frames 
He went round the forest but did't find the adequate wood 
He then drifted towards the seashore where he saw a huge tree 
He thought that if he could cut wood from the tree,
he would have enough wood for all frames for the rest of his life 
As the weaver raised his axe to cut the tree,
a spirit living on that tree called out,
 O weaver, this tree is my home and it must be spared in any event,
because it prevents my body from the cool breeze which comes from the sea  
Mantharaka said,
 Sir, if I don't cut the tree and take its wood home,
then my family will starve and die 
So, please go somewhere else as I have to cut this tree  
The spirit tried to lure him,
 If you do not cut the tree,
I will give you a boon of your choice  
 The weaver thought for a while and said,
 Sir, in that case,
I will go home and ask my wife and friends 
When I will return,
you must give me what I ask for  
The spirit agreed to it and the weaver returned home with joy 
On his way back he met his friend,
the barber, and said, Friend, a spirit has given me a boon of my choice and gave me time to consult friends and my wife 
Tell me what I should demand from him  
The barber replied,
 My dear friend,
demand a kingdom where you could be the King and I would be your Prime Minister 
You would have a palace,
where we could enjoy a luxurious life  
Mantharaka said,  True 
But let me ask my wife too  
The barber was a selfish man and he wanted to stop him from consulting his wife lest he would lose his chance to be the prime Minister But Mantharaka was admant 
He replied,  Even though it is a good idea,
still I would consult my wife,
as she is my better half  
On reaching home,
he narrated the whole story of the spirit and his boon to his wife 
He also told her what the barber had advised 
His wife said,
 O my lord, no wise man would consult children or barbers or servents or beggars 
A King's life is full of hardships 
He never gets a minute's rest  
The weaver said,
 You are right 
But you haven't told me what boon I should ask for  
She answered,
 Every day you are able to weave a single piece of cloth which is barely enough to meet our daily needs 
You should ask for another pair of arms and another head so that you can work on two piece of cloth at one time,
one in front of you, and one behind you 
The first pice will help us meet our our daily needs 
The second one will help us meet special needs 
Thus, we can live comfortably and happily  
Mantharaka agreed with his wife 
He happily went to the spirit and said,
 Sir, you have kindly given me a choice 
I request you to give me two more hands and an extra head 
 He had hardly spoken before he was two-handed and four-armed 
Rejoiced, the poor weaver began his homeward journey 
People on the way saw him and considering him as a kind of demon,
stoned him to death 
The Gold Giving Serpent
Once upon a time,
there was a poor Brahmin farmer named Haridatta 
He used to work hard in the field,
but could not get anything out of it 
One day, after the tiring working hours,
he lay down in the shade of the tree which stood in the middle of the field 
Just then, he saw a terrible snake with a big hood coming out of an anthill 
He thought that the serpent might be the guardian deity of the field and thinking that he had never worship it,
that could be the reason for the barreness of the fields 
Instanly, he brought some milk in a bowl and offered it to the serpent 
While offering the milk with due regards,
he addressed the serpent,
 O Guardian of this field!
I didn't know that you reside here and that's why I never offered you anything 
Please forgive me 
 Saying this he left the bowl and went to his house 
Next day, when the poor farmer came to plough the field,
he found a gold coin in the bowl near the anthill 
Now, that became a regular feature of Brahmin's life 
He served milk to the serpent everyday and found a gold coin in retuen,
the next day 
One day, Haridatta had to go to the foreign lands 
He would be away from home for a few days and so for this reason,
he asked his son to take care of the serpent 
The son brought the milk to the anthill and offered it to the serpent 
Next day,
when he came back,
he found a gold coin in the bowl 
After taking the gold coin,
he thought,
 This anthill must be full of gold coins 
I will kill the serpent and take them all  
The following day,
the brahmin's son came to the field with the milk and the stick 
He offered the milk to the snake and then,
struck its hood with the stick 
The snake escape the blow of the stick and in a rage bit the boy to his death 
Two days later,
Haridatta returned to his village and came to know the death of his son 
He grieved and mourned 
But after a while,
he again went to the field 
He praised the snake in a loud voice and kept the milk near the anthill 
The snake came out of the anthill and said,
Brahmin, it is greed that brings you here 
You could forget the death of your only son so easily!
so now on our friendship is not possible 
I helped you when you were in need but I shall not serve your greed 
The Foolish Monkey
Once upon a time,
there was a king who kept a monkey as a pet 
The monkey served the king in whatever way he could 
No one in the kingdom dared to tease him 
He had a free run of the royal household because he was the king's pet 
One hot day,
the monkey sat fanning by the side of the king who was sleeping 
He noticed a fly sitting on the king's chest,
which distrubed the king 
The monkey tried to swish her away so that the king could sleep peacefully 
The fly went away for the moment but came back again to sit on the king's chest 
The monkey could take it no longer 
 I must teach the fly a lesson,  he decided 
He quitely left the king's room to look for a dagger to kill the fly 
When he found it,
he return to the king's room 
The fly was still sitting on the chest of the king 
The monkey raised the dagger band brought it down with all his might on the fly 
Then fly flew away but the king died as a result of the dagger blow delivered by the monkey 
The Princess and the Pea
Once upon a time,
There was a handsome young prince who decided to get married 
You must marry a real, genune princess,
The Queen instisted  
She must be beautifull, clever, charming and kind 
Nothing less will do,
my son!
Agreeing with his mother,
The Princess travelled all over the world to find the real Princess 
There were many Princess,
But it was difficult to find out if they were real,genuine ones 
None of them seemed perfect 
There was always something about them that that was not right 
Some were too tall and some were too short,
Other too thine or too fat 
Some were very old and some were very young 
The Prince was really disappointed 
 I just can't seem to fine a real, genuine Princess anywhere 
He sighed and began the long journey back to his kingdom 
He would have liked very much to have a real Princess as his bride 
But when, at least he returned home,
He decided to give up the idea altogether 
One dark night a tririble strom come on,
There was thunder and lighting,
And the rain pourd down in torrents 
In spite of all this noise,
The king heard a knock on the palace door 
Who can be there on a night like this?
Said the Queen as the king went to open the door 
There was a young girl standing in the doorway 
Her clothes were soaking and her shoes were spattered with mud 
Rain water ran down her face and and her long golden hair were all wet and bedraggled 
Who are you?
The king asked her gemtly 
I am a Princess 
May I come in? She whimpered 
Princess or not,
First come in by the fire and get warm,
The king said and led her into the great hall of his palace 
When the Prince saw her standing in firelight,
He fell in love with her and wanted to maary her at once 
However, the Queen looked at the girl and frowned 
She can't be a real,
Genuine Princess and look such a mess,
She muttered to herself 
 Well, we'll soon find that out, 
She thought but said nothing 
The Queen marched off towards the palace kitchen 
From the store cupboard,
She took one tiny dried pea and crept quitly up the back stairs into the guest room 
There she took all the bedding off the bedstead,
And laid the pea there 
She send for all the maids in the palace and ordered in her sternest voice,
 Bring me twenty mattresses from your linen cupboard at once and pile them up high on the bed 
Then place twenty of your softest feather quilts on top of the twenty mattresses 
The maids looked surprised,
But were soon scurrying up and down the corridors puffing and painting,
Under the weight of the heavy mattresses 
The pile of mattresses was so high that the maids could no longer reach them 
So the Queen ordered her pageboys to bring long ladders 
The maids then pulled the quilts up the ladders untill, at least the job was done and the Queen was satisfied 
While all this was going on,
The Princess had dried out from her soaking and was ready for bed 
The Queen led her to the guest room 
The Princess climed up the ladder right to the top of the twenty mattresses and twenty quilts 
She had to lie there all night 
Next morning, the strom had passed 
The wind had died down and the strom clouds had gone from the sky 
Bright sunshine streamed in through the palace windows,
And it was a beautiful day 
the Princess, however, come down looking very pale and tired 
The Queen asked hr,
Did you sleep well?
 Oh, very badly!  said the Princess 
 I have scarcely closed my eyes all night 
Heaven only knows what was in the bed,
But I was lying on something hard 
I am black and blue all over the my body 
The Queen was very happy,
Much to the surprise of others 
She held the hand of the Princess and led her to the guest room 
She send for her pageboys and ordered them to remove the quilts and the mattresses 
One by one the pageboys took away the feather quilts and the mattresses 
And there, lying right in the middle of the bed was one tiny dried pea!
 Only a real, genuine Princess could feel a tiny pea through all those quilts an mattresses 
No one else could be as sensitive as that, 
Laughed the Queen with delight 
When the Prince heard the story,
He asked the Princess to marry him 
Not because she had proved she was a real, genuine Princess,
But because he had fallen in love with her when he first saw her 
So, the Princess married the Princess and they lived happily ever after
Sleeping Beauty
Long ago there lived a King and Queen who said every day,
 If only we had a child 
But for a long time they had none 
One day, when the Queen was bathing,
A frog crept out the water onto the land, and said to her,
 Your wish shall be fullfilled,
Before a year has gone by,
You shall have a daughter  
And since frogs are such magical creatures,
It was no surprise that before a year had passed the Queen gave birth to the baby girl 
The girl was so pretty that the King could not contain his joy 
He ordered a great feast and invited all his friends, family and acquaintances 
He also invited the fairies in order that they might be kind and bless the child 
There were thirteen of them in his kingdom,
But, as he had only twelve golden plates for them to eat from,
One of them had to left out 
No one was saddened by this as the thirteen fairy was known to be cruel and spiteful 
At the end of the amazing feast,
Each fairy presented the baby girl with a magic gift 
One gave virtue, secound gave beauty, the third gave riches, and so on with everthing in the world that anyony can wish for 
When eleven of them had presented their gifts,
The thirteen suddendly appeared 
She was angry and wanted to avenge herself for not being invited 
Without hesitation she called out in a loud voice,
The King's daugther shall in her fifteenth year prick herself with a spindle,
And fall down dead :
Then without another words,
She turned round and left the room 
Each fairy presented the baby girl with a magic gift 
Everyone was shocked and the Queen fell to the floor sobbing,
But the twelve fairy, whose good wish still remained unspoken,
Quielty stepped forward 
Her magic could mot undo the curse,
But she could soften it,
So, she said, into which the Princess shall fall 
The King, determined to prevent the curse,
Gave that orders that every spindle in the whole kingdom should be destroyed 
No one in the kingdom was allowed to tell the Princess of the curse that had been placed upon her for they did not want to worry 
Over the year,
The gift of the fairies came true one by one 
The Princess grew to be so beautiful, modest, good-natured,
And wish, that everyone who saw her could not help but love her 
It happened that on the very day when she was fifteen years old,
The Princess awoke early 
She was up so early in the morning,
That she realised everyone else was still sleeping 
So she wandered about the whole place,
Looking at the rooms and halls as she pleased and at last she came to an old tower 
She climed up the narrow winding staircase, and reached a little door 
A rusty key was in the lock, and when she turned it the door sparng open 
In a little room sat an old woman with a spindle, busily spinning her flax 
Good morning, Granny, said the Princess,
 What are you doing? 
I am spinning , said old woman 
 What is the thing that rattles round so merrily?
Asked the Princess and she took the spindle and tried to spin too 
But she had scarcerly touched the spindle when she felt the prick,
She fell down upon the bed that stood there and lay in a deep sleep 
This sleep extended over the whole palace 
The King, Queen and servants had all stared their morning rountines and right in the midst of them fell sleep too 
The horses in the stable, the dogs in the yard, the pigeons on the roof,
And the flies on the wall, all fell asleep 
Even the fire on the hearth became quiet and still,
And the kitchen maid, who sat with a chicken before her,
Ready to pluck its feathers, also fell asleep 
The wind died down and on the trees in front of the castle not a leaf moved again 
A thorny hedge began to grow up round the castle 
But the thorns held fast togather,
As if they were alive,
And the young Princes who were entangled in them could not get again,and died a pitiful death 
After many years,
A very handsome young Prince came to the country and heard an old man tell the tale of the castlewhich stood behind the thorny hedge and the beautiful Princess who had asleep within for a hundred years 
He had heard, too, from his grandfather,
That many Princes had already come,
And had tried to get througt the thorny hedge,
But none had succeeded and had been caught in it and died 
The young Prince said,
 I am not afraid 
I must go and see this sleeping beauty  
The old man tried to persuade him not to go,
But the Prince would not listen 
By this time the hundred years had just passed,
And the day had come when Sleeping Beauty was awake 
When the Prince approached the thorny hedge,
Which was covered with beautiful large roses,
It parted on its own and let him pass unhurt 
Then it closed again behind him like a hedge 
In the castle yard,
The Prince saw the horses and the dogs lying asleep,
On the roof sat the motionless pigeons 
When he went into the house,
The flies were asleep on the walls and the servants asleep in the halls 
Near the thorne lay the King and Queen,
Sleeping peacefully beside each other 
In the kitchen, the fire on the hearth was still,
And the maid was sitting by the chicken which she was going to pluck 
All was so quiet that he could hear his own breathing 
He went up the stairs and opened the door into the little room where the beautiful Princess was sleeping 
There she lay,
So lovely that he could not turn his eyes away,
And he stooped down and gave her a kiss 
But as soon as he kissed her,
Sleeping Beauty opened her eyes and smiled at him 
They went down togather 
Throughout the castle,
Everyone everything woke up and looked at each other with astonished eyes 
A few days later that had lain in silence for so long now rang with the sound of singing,
Music and happy laughteras the Prince and Sleeping Beauty were married,
And the two lived happily ever after 
The Frog Prince
Once upon a time,
There lived a young Princess who adored objects made of gold 
Her favourite toy in the world was a golden ball 
On hot days, she liked to sit beside an odl well in the cool forest,
Tossing the ball in the air 
One day, the ball slipped from her fingers into the well 
She peeped inside the well to see how far the ball had fallen,
But the well was deep that she could see nothing 
oh dear, I'll never fined it! 
The Princess said, and began to cry 
Suddenly, a voice called out from bellow 
 What's the matter, beautiful Princess?
Why are you crying? 
The Princess looked all around but couldn't see anyone 
 Down here, beautiful Princess, 
Said the voice to get her attention 
The Princess looked down and saw a green frog poking his head out of the water 
 Oh! It's only you, 
She said and continued between sobs,
 If you must know, I'm crying because my golden ball fell into the well  
 I could get it back for you , 
Said the frog as he jumped out and sat on the well's wall 
 But what will you give me as a reward? 
The Princess stopped crying 
 Whatever you like dear frog 
How about my pearls and jewels, 
The Princess suggested,  or perhaps my golden crown? 
 What would Ido with pearls, jewels or crown?
Said the frog 
Raising her brows and tilting her head,
The princess asked,
 Then? 
 How about making a pormise? 
The Princess frowned in thought and said,
Hmm… and what will that be? 
 Promise that I can be your best friend,
And come for dinner and sleep over at your palace  
 All right, you can be my best friend, 
Agreed the princess,
Thinking that there was no sense in what the frog had said 
The frog dived deep into the well and soon returned with the golden ball at the Princess's feet,
She grabbed it and ran home,
Without even thanking the frog 
 Wait!  called the frog,
 I can't run that fast  
But the Princess paid no attention to him 
Back at the castle,
The Princess forgot all about the frog,
But the next day,
As she was eating dinner with her father,
She heard some one knocking on the door 
Then a voice called,
 Princess, please open the door! 
The Princess ran to open the door,
But when she saw the frog standing there,
All green and dripping,
She slammed it on his face and ran back to her seat 
The King left that something was the matter 
 Has a giant come to get you? 
He asked showing concern 
 Oh, no, father  It's only a nasty frog, 
She replied  
 And what does a frog want from you? 
The King asked curiously 
As the Princess explained,
They heard more knocking 
 Let me in, Princess,
 The frog pleaded 
 Have you forgotten what you pormised? 
The King heard every word the frog said 
 If you made a promise, then, youn must keep it  Let him in  
Said the King 
The Princess sulked but she loved her father too much to disobey him 
She opened the door and led the frog to the table 
 Please lift me upon chair,
And let me eat next to you, 
He said to the Princess 
 No! I won't, 
The Princess said, but her father gave her such a look that she changed her mind 
The chair wasn't high enough so the frog asked to be lifted onto the table 
And once there,
He said,
 Put your plate nearer to me so I can eat out of it  
The Princess moved her plate,
But it was quite clear she didn't enjoy the rest of her meal 
Once the frog had finished eating,
Hes said,  I am tired 
Carry me upstairs so I can sleep in your room 
The frog thought of sharing her room with the cold damp frog made the Princess so upset that she began to cry 
But the King said,
 Be on your way, dear 
It's not right to turn your back on someone who helped you when you were in trouble  
 Yes father, 
Said the Princess,
And she carefully picked up the frog 
When she got to her room,
She set the frog down in the corner farthest from her bed 
But the moment she stood up to leave,
She heard the frog plop down beside her 
 I'm tired, too, 
The frog said 
 Lift me into your bed  
The Princess quietly tucked the frog into her bed,
With his little green head resting on a fluffy pillow 
But when she slipped in between the sliken sheets of her bed,
She was surprised to hear the frog sobbing quietly 
 What's the matter now,
Little frog? 
She asked 
 All I ever wanted was a friend, 
The frog replied 
 But it's clear that you don't like me at all!
I might as well go back to the well 
At this, the Princess felt very said bad 
She sat down on the edge of the bed by frog's side 
 I'll be your friend, 
She said,
And this time she meant it 
Then the Princess gave him a goodnight kissin his small green cheek 
Instantly a miracle occurred 
The frog was transformed into a very handsome young prince!
The princess could not have been more surprised to see such a handsome prince standing right in front of her and looking at her with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen 
The prince smiled at the princess and said,
 I had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy 
She had changed me into a frog and I have been cursed to remain a frog till some princess should take me out of the well,
And let me eat from her plate,
And sleep in her bed,
And kiss me  
 You, my lovely princess, 
The prince continued,
 Have broken this cruel charm and now I have nothing to wish for but to marry you,
And love you as long as you live 
Will you be my bride? 
The princess immediately said,
 Yes  to the prince 
Soon, they were married and they lived happily ever after

She lived with her father,
Stepmother and two stepsisters 
After the death of her father,
The wicked mother nad her daughters began treating Cinderella like a slave 
They made her do all the household chores and never feel part of the family

The stepmother and her daughters dressed up and went to the ball 
They left poor Cinderella all alone at home sobbing and doing the house work 
Deep in her heart Cinderella wished she could also somehow go to the Royal Ball 
Suddenly a fairy appeared out of nowhere 
She asked Cinderella ,
 Do you want to atten the Royal Ball? 
Cinderella said,
 Yes  
But when she looked at herself she felt disappointed 
 How can I go to the Ball dressed in rags? 
She asked the fairy

She looked absolutely goreous 
The fairy asked Cinderella to bring a big pumkin,
And her cat to bring seven live mice 
With her magic wand she turned the pumkin into a sparkling coach,
Six mice into white horses and the seventh mouse into a well-dressed coachman 
Cinderella could not believe her eyes 
Before Cinderella left,
The fairy said,
 Remember to come back before 12'o clock 
That is when my spell ends 
Everything that I have given to you will disapear and you will become your old self again  
Cinderella replied,
 Yes I will  
At the ball,
Everyone was looking at her and appreciating her beauty 
Even her own stepsisters could not recognise her!
The prince danced with her several times and fell in love with her 
Cinderella heard the first stroke of midnight and remembered the fairy's words 
She rushed out of the ball roo 
As she ran down the stairs in hurr,
One of her shoes came off 
But she did not stop to pick it up and left 
The prince, who followed her,
Picked up the shoe and to his ministers,
 Go find the girl whose foot this shoe fits  
The ministers tried the shoe on the foot of every girl in the kingdom until only Cinderella was left 
The next day,
The prince took the shoe to Cinderella's house 
One by one, her stepsisters tried to put on the shoe but it fitted no one 
At last the prince made Cinderella to wear the shoe 
The shoe fitted her feet perfectly 
The prince was extremely happy 
Cinderella's stepmother and sisters were shocked 
The prince fell in love with Cinderella all over again 
He married her and took her his palace,
Where they lived happily ever after 
Rumplestiltskin
Once there was a poor miller,
Who had a beautiful daughter 
One day,
He was send for by the king 
The miller, who had never been to court,
Felt very restless 
So, instead of saying something sensible,
Or keeping quiet,
He said to the king,
 I have a daughter who can spin gold out of straw  
The miller thought he had spoken words that would make the king think high of him 
The king said to the miller,
 That is an art which please me well 
If your daughter is as clever as you say,
Bring her tommorrow to my castle,
And I will put her to the test 
The next day,
The miller brought her daughter to court 
At once,
The king led her to a room which was quite full of straw 
Nothing else was in the room but a spinning wheel 
 Now set to work, 
Said the king,
 And if between tonight and tommorrow at dawn you have not spun this straw into gold,
You must die  
Thereupon he himself locked up the room,
And left her in the room alone 
So there sat the poor miller's beautihul daughter,
Not knowing what to do,
For she had no idea now straw could be spun into gold 
She grew more and more fringhtened,
until at last she could only hide her face in her hands and weep 
Suddenly, the locked door flew open and a queer-looking little man came in 
His coat and loose trousers were made of white cotton,
With large red dots 
On his head he wore a red and white hat with a cock's feather 
In his right hand he held a wand 
 Good evening,
Mistress Miller 
Why are you crying? 
 Alas!  answered the girl between sobs 
 I have to spin straw into gold and I have don't know how to do it  
 But I do know, 
Said the little man 
 What will you give me if I spin it for you? 
 My necklace, 
Said the miller's daughter 
Little man took the necklace and sat down before the spinning wheel 
He spun, and he spun,
and all the reels were full of gold 
Then with a low bow he vanished 
At sunrise the king came,
and was astonished to see so much gold 
But it only made him want still more 
So he took the miller's daughter to a larger room,
full of straw,
and he said,
 Now set to work,
and if,
between tonight and tommorrow at dawn,
you have not spun this straw into gold,
you must die  
The lonely girl did not know how to help herself,
and began to cry 
But in a moment the door flew open and again the curious little man stood before her 
 What will you give me of if I spin this straw into gold for you? 
He said 
 The ring on my finger, 
answered the girl 
The little man took the ring,
and sat down before the spinning wheel 
He spun, and he spun,
until all the straw had disappeared and all the reels were filled with gold 
Then with a low bow the little man again disappeared 
Next morning when the king came,
he was delighted to see the shining gold 
But he was not yet satisfied 
He thought,
 Even if she be a miller's daughter,
I could not find a richer wife in the whole world 
 So he led the miller's daughter to a still larger room,
full of straw,
and this time he said,
 Spin this into gold and you shall be my queen 
I shall come again at sunrise  
Then he left her 
When the girl was alone,
the curious little man came again for the third time,
and he once more found the girl weeping 
He said,
 What will you give me if I spin the straw for you this time also? 
 Alas, I have nothing left that I can give! 
said the girl 
Then promise me,
if you become the queen,
you will give me your first child  
 Who knows whether that will ever happen, 
thought the miller's daughter 
So she promised the strange little man what he wanted,
and for that he once more spun the straw into gold 
Then with his usual low bow he vanished 
When the king came in the morning,
and found all as he had wished,
he married the miller's daughter 
Thus, the miller's daughter became the queen 
A year after,
the king and queen had a beautiful child 
The queen ha quite forgotten her pormise to the little man and was verry happy,
when suddenly he came into her room one day,
and said,
 Now give me what you pormised  
Taken aback,
the queen hekd her little one safely in her arm and said she would part with all the riches of her kingdom if only she could keep the child 
Then the poor mother wept as if her heart would break 
Finally,
the little man took pity on her,
and said,
 I will give you three days time and if by that tine you find out my name,
then you shall keep your child  
The queen lay awake all night,
thinking of all the odd names she had ever heard 
The next day the little man came again,
and the queen repeated all the names she could remember,
one after the other 
But to everyone the little man said,
 No, that is not my name  
Next morning ,
the queen send a messanger all through the kingdom to collect all the odd names he could find 
When the little man came the secound time,
she tried all sorts of strange names the messenger had collected 
But,
to every name,
the little man only shook his head saying,
 No,
that is not my name   
On the third day,
the messenger came back again and said,
I have bot been able to find any new name,
but as I came round the corner of a wood,
at the foot of a high mountain,
I saw a little house 
A fire was burning in front of it,
and round the fire a wicked little man was jumping,
hopping on one leg and singing 
Although today I brew and bake,
Tommorrow the queen's own child I take 
So nobody tell,
for goodness' sake,
That my name is Rumplestilskin 
Oh! How joyful the queen was when she hearthis!
Soon afterwards, the litlle man came in and asked,
 Now, dear queen,
what is my name? 
The queen was now merry enough to be mischievous,
so, instead of saying his real name at once,
she said out some unusual names and to each,
the little man said,  No  
He was happy that the queen will now have to give away her child 
Sensing the little man's happiness,
the queen cried out in excitement,
Then it is Rumplestilskin  
When the little man heard this,
he flew into a terrible rage 
 Some witch must have told you that! 
he cried and he stamped his right foot on the ground so violently that the whole leg went in 
Then, wild with fury,
he pulled his left leg so heard with boyh hands that he tore himself into two 
Then Rumplestiltskin hopped away and was never heard of again 
And the queen lived happily with her baby 
The Crystal Ball
Once upan a time,
there lived an enchatress,
who had threes sons 
The three brothers lived togather and loved each other,
but their mother did not trust them,
and suspected that they wanted to steal her power from her 
Giving in to her susoicion,
she changed her eldest son into an eagle,
which was forced to dwell in the rocky mountains,
and was often seen sweeping in great circles in the sky 
She changed her second son into a whale,
which lived in the deep sea,
and was rarely seen spouted up a great jet of water in the air 
Each son could take his human form for only two hours every day 
The third son,
who was afraid that his mother might change him into some raging wild beast,
secretly went away 
He had heard that King's daughter who was bewitched,
was imprisioned in the Castle of the Golden Sun,
and was waiting to be recued from this bondage 
Those who tried to free her had risked their lives 
Twenty three youths had already died a miserable death,
and now only one more could make the attempt 
And as his heart knew no fear,
he decided to seek out the Castle of the Golden Sun 
After having travelled about for a long time without being able to find the Castle,
the young man found himself in a deep forest 
He was trying to find his way out of the forest when, all at once,
he saw two gaints calling him by the gesture of their hands 
When he went near them,
they said,
We are quarreling for an old cap,
and which of us should it belong to 
As we are equally strong,
neither of us can get the better of the other 
The small men are cleverer than we are,
so we leave the decision to you  
 How can you fight over an old cap? 
Said the youth 
 You speak thus because you don't know what properties this caphas! 
Said one giant 
The young man simply shrugged his shoulders 
The giant went on,
 It is a wishing-cap 
Whosoever puts it on,
can wish himself away wherever he likes,
and within no time he will be there  
 Give me the cap, 
said the young man,
 I will go a short distance off,
and when I call you,
you must runa race 
The cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me  
He put the cap on his head and strated to walk away 
As he walked,
hw began to think of the king's dauhgter and forgot the giants 
At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart,
and cried,
 Ha, if I were but at the Castle of the Golden Sun,
 And hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain near the Castle 
He entered the castle,
walked on the long paths and went through all the rooms,
until he found the king's daughter 
But he was shocked when he saw her 
She had and ashen-gray face full of wrinkles,
blear eyes,
and red hair 
 Are you the king's daughter,
whose beauty the whole world praisees? 
He asked her in dibelief 
 Yes, 
She answered 
 but this is not my from 
Human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness,
but if you must know what I am like,
look in the mirror for it does not let itself miled and will show you my true image  
She gave him a mirror in his hand,
and he show therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth,
and who the tears were rolling down her cheeks in grief 
Then he said,
Who can you be set free?
I fear no danger  
She said,
He who gets the crystal ball,
and holds it before the enchanter,
will distroy his power with it,
and I shall resume my true form  
 But ,  she added,
 so many have already died for this 
You are so young and if worries me that you should encounter such great danger  
Don't worry, 
he tried to convince her 
Nothing can keep me from doing it, 
he said,
but tell me what I must do  
All right, you can be my best friend, 
I shall tell you everything, 
she said 
When you descend the mountain on which the castle stands,
you will find a wild bull standing by the spring 
You must fight with it,
and if you have the luck to kill,
a fiery bird will arise out of it 
This bird bears in its body a burning egg,
and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk 
The bird will not,
However, let the egg fall untill forced to do so,
and if it falls on the ground,
it will flame up and burn everything that is near,
even ice, and with it the crystal ball,
and then all your afforts will go wasted  
The young man went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and bellowed at him 
After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal's body,
and it fell down 
Isntantly a feiry bird arose from it,
and was about to fly away,
brother, the eagle,
who was passing between the clouds,
swooped down,
hunted it away to sea,
and struck it with his beak,
in its extremity,
until it let egg fall 
However, the egg did not fall into the sea,
but on a fisherman's hut which stood on the shore 
At once,
the roof of the hut began to smoke and the hut was about to break out in flames,
when in the sea arose high waves,
which streamed over the hut,
and subdued the fire 
The young man's brother,
the whale,
had come swimming to them,
and had driven the water up so high 
when the fire died down,
the young man sought for the egg and happily found it 
It was not yet melted,
but the shell was broken,
and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt 
Having obtained the crystal ball,
the young man went to the enchanter 
As he held the crystal ball before the enchanter,
the latter felt his powers getting grained 
When the enchanter had no power left,
he said to the young man,
 My power is destroyed,
and now you shall be the king of the Castle of the Golden Sun 
The King's daughter shall regain her true from  
 Not only this, 
he continued,
 your brothers shall als get back into their human form  
The young man hastened to the Castle to see the king's daughter,
and when he entered her room,
he was mesmerised 
She was standing there in the full splendour of her beauty,
and smiling joyfully 
The man asked her to marry him,
to which she readily agreed 
And both lived in the Castle of the Golden Sun happily forever 
Rapunzel
Once upon a time,
there was a childless couple 
They had long in vain wished for a child 
Through the small rear window of their house,
the couple could see into a splendid garden that was filled with the most beautiful flowers and herbs 
It was,
however, surrounded by a high wall,
and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress,
who possessed great power and was dreaded by everyone 
One day the woman standing at the window,
and she saw a bed planted with the most beautiful rapunzel 
It looked so fresh aand green that she longed for it,
and had the greatest desire to eat some
This desire increased every day,
and as she knew that she could not get any of it,
she quite pined away,
and began to lok pale and miserable 
Her husband was alarmed,
and asked,
 What makes you sad,
my dear wife  
 Oh,  she repiled,
 if I can't eat some of the rapunzel,
which is in the garden behind our house,
I shall die  
Then man,
loved his wife dearly 
He thought,
 Before I let my wife die,
I must bring her some of the rapunzel  
At twilight,
he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress,
hastily cluctched a bunch of rapunzel,
and took it to his wife 
She at once made herself a salad of it,
and ate it greedily 
It tasted so very good,
that by next day her desire for more had grown threefold 
If she were to have any peace,
the man would have to climb into the garden obnce again 
In the gloom of evening,
therefore, he let himself down again 
But when he had clambered down the wall,
he got terribly afraid,
for he saw the enchantress standing before him 
 How adare you, 
she asked with an angry look,
 descend into my garden and steal my rapunzel like a thief 
you shall suffer for it  
He pleaded,
Let mercy take the place of justice 
I only made up my mind to do so out of necessity 
My wife saw your rapunzel from the window,
and felt such a longing for it that she would die if she did not get some to eat  
Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened,
and said,
If the case is as you say,
I will allow you to take away with you as much rapunzel as you want 
But under one condition that you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world 
I will treat the child well and take care like a mother  
In his fear the man consented to everything,
and when his wife gave birth to a child,
the enchantress apppeared,
named the child Rapunzel,
and took her away with her 
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun 
When she was twelve years old,
the enchantress kept her into a tower that stood in a forest,
and that had neither stairs nor door,
but only a tiny little window at the top 
Whenever the enchantress wanted to go in,
she would place herself beneath it amd cry,
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair to me  
Rapunzel had magnificent long hair,
fine has spun gold 
On hearing the voice of the enchantress she would wind her braided tresses,
round one of the window hooks,
and let her hair fell twent yards down,
and the enchantress would climb up by it 
After a year,
it so happened that the king's son was riding through the forest 
Has he approched the tower he heard a song so beautiful that he stood still to listen 
It was rapunzel,
who in her solitude,
passed the time by singing in her sweet voice 
The prince wanted to climb up to her,
and looked for a door of the tower,
but none was to be found 
He rode home,
but the song had so deeply touched his heart that he returned to the forest every day and listened to it 
One day ,
as he was thus standing behind a tree,
he saw the enchantress appoach,
and heard her say,
 Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hait to me  
Then he saw her climbing up by the hair 
 If that is the ladder into the tower,
then sometime I will try my luck, 
he thought,
and the next day,
just as it was beginning to get dark,
he went to the tower and called out,
Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair to me  
Immediately the hair fell down and he climb up 
Rapunzel was terribly frightened to see a man,
such as her eyes had never seen before 
But the princess began talking to her in a friendly manner and said,
 My heart has been so touched by your singing that it has let me have no rest,
and I have been forced to see you  
As Rapunzel relaxed a bit,
the prince asked her,
Will you take me for your husband? 
Rapunzel saw that he was young and handsome,
and thought,
He will love me more than old dame gothic does  
She agreed and said,
I will willingly go away with you,
but I do not know how to get down 
every time that you come,
bring a strand of silk,
from which I will weave a ladder,
and when that is ready I will descend,
and you will take on your horse  
They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening,
for the old woman came by day 
The enchantress did not notice what was happening until one day Rapunzel said to her,
Tell me,
why it is that you are more difficult to pull up than is the young prince,
who will be arriving any moment now? 
You wicked child, 
cried the enchantress 
What do I hear you say?
I thought I had separated you from the whole world,
but you have deceived me  
In her anger she grabbed Rapunzel's beautifully braided tresses,
wrapped them round her left hand,
seized a pair of scissors with the right,
and snipped them off 
The lovely braid lay on the floor 
and she was so pitiless that she took for Rapunzel into a wilderness where she had to live in great grief and misery 
That evening,
the enchantress fastened the braid of Rapunzel's hair,
which she had cut off,
to the hook of the window,
and waited for the king's son 
Soon enough,
when he came and cried out to Rapunzel to let down her hair,
she let the hair down 
The prince climbed up,
but above,
instead of his beloved Rapunzel,
he found the enchantress, who peered at him with evil looks 
Aha,  she cried mockingly,
you have come here to petch your dearest,
but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest 
The cat has got it,
and will scratch out your eyes as well 
You have lost Rapunzel 
You will never she her again  
The prince was beside himself with pain,
and his despair he lapt down from the tower 
He escaped with his life,
but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes 
Blinded, he wandered about in the forest,
ate nothing but roots and berries,
and did nothing but lament and weep over the lost of his dear wife 
Thus he roamed about in misery for some years,
and at last came to the wilderness where Rapunzel lived miserable with the twins that she had given birth to 
He heard a voice,
and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it,
and when he approached,
Rapunzel recognized him 
She embraced him and cried with joy 
To of her tears fell into his eyes and they became clear once again,
and he could see as before 
He took her and the children to his kingdom where they lived together happily and contended for a very long time 
Snow White And yhe Seven Dwarfs
Once upon a time, a beautiful baby girl was born to a Queen 
She was very pretty,
with blue eyes and long black hair 
Her skin was delicate and fair and her lips were as red as the colour of blood 
The Queen called her Snow White 
After a few years,
Snow White's mother died and her father married again 
The new Queen,
Snow White's stepmother,
was a beautiful woman,
but she was wickedtoo 
More than anything eles,
she wanted to certain that she was the most beautiful woman in the world 
The Queen had a magic mirror that never failed to speak the truth 
Each day,
she used to look at herself in that mirror and say,
 Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all? 
And the mirror would always reply,
 You, O Queen,
are the fairest one of all  
The Queen would simle when she heard this 
With each passing year,
Snow White grew prettier and prettier 
One day,
her stepmother looked in the magic mirror and said,
 Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all? 
And then mirror repied,
You, O Queen, are fair,
this true,
but Snow White is fairer now than you  
The stepmother got jeolous and plotted to get rid of her stepdaughter 
she called one of her servants and told him,
 Take Snow White deep into the forest,
far away from the castle and kill her 
Take out her heart and bring it back to me  
The servant was very sad 
Like everyone in the king's household,
he loved Snow but he have to obey the promised made to the queen,When deep into the forest and when he took out his dagger to kill her,
she pleaded,
 Please spare my life and leave me here 
I'll never return to the palace,
I pormise  
The servant agreed gladly and left the place 
On his way back,
he killed a young deer and cut out his heart to take it to the Queen,
pretending it was Snow White's heart 
Poor Snow White was left all alone in the dark forest 
Tired,
lonely and hungry,
she began to cry bitterly 
She wandered through the trees,
in search of berries and nuts to keep her alive 
Then she came upon a strange cottage,
with a tiny door,
tiny windows and a tiny chimney pot 
Everything about the cottage was much tinner than it ought to be 
She knocked at the door 
When there was no answer,
she pushed the door open 
There she saw a room all spick and span with a long table laid for seven people 
There were seven knives and forks,
Seven wooden plates and drinking cups,
and on the plates and in the cups were food and drink 
Snow White was so hungry that she took some from each plate and each cup 
Then she went upstairs 
there were seven little neatly made beds 
She found one that was comfartable,
and fell into a deep sleep,
for she was fully exhausted 
The cottage was the home of seven dwarfs 
All day long they worked in a nearby mine digging diamonds from deep inside the mountain 
When they returned home that evening,
they were amazed to see that someone haad been into their cottage and had taken some food and drink from each plate and cup laid on their table 
They were also surprised to find their beds distrubed,
until one dwarf called out that he had found a lovely girl asleep on his bed 
Back at the palace,
the Queen welcomed her servant when he returned with the deer's heart 
She was happy that now she was once more the most beautiful woman in the world 
As soon as she was alone,
she looked in her magic mirror and said,
confidently,  Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all? 
 You, O Queen,
are fair,
tis true,
but snow white is fairer than you  
The Queen was furious 
She realised she was tricked by her servant,
so she decided to find snow white and killed herself 
Disguising herself as an old pedlar woman she set out into the forest 
When she came upon the cottage,
she saw Snow White waving goodbye to the seven dwarfs 
After the dwarfs have left,
she knocked at the cottage door 
 pretty lady, 
she called out pleasantly,
would you like some ribbons or buttons,
some buckles,
a new lacing for your dress? 
and smiled a wicked smile when Snow White opened the door 
 Here,  she said picking up a lace from her basket,
 let me help you tie this pretty lace for you  
Then she pullled the lacing so tight that Snow White could not breathe,
and fell to the floor,
as if she were dead 
The Queen hurried back to her palace,
sure that this time Snow White was really dead 
When the dwarfs came home that evening,
they found Snow White lying on the floor,
deathly pale and still 
Horrified, they gathered around her 
When they spotted a new lacing on her dress,
and that it was tied very tightly,
one of them quickly cut it 
Snow White began to breathe again and all seven dwarfs heaved a sigh of relief as by now they loved her dearly 
After this,
they begged Snow White to allow no strangers into the cottage while she alone,
and Snow White promised she would do as they said 
That evening,
the Queen was outraged when the mirror told her that Snow White is still the fairest 
She made up her mind to try again 
So, disguising herself as an old peasant woman,
she put a poisoned apple with the others in her basket and set out for the dwarfs' cottage 
Snoww white was in the kitchen when she heard the knock at the door 
 Who's there? 
she called suspiciously,
remembering the dwarfs' advice 
I'm an old peasant woman selling apples, 
came the reply 
 I don't need any apples 
Moreover, I'm not supposed to open the door to anyone, 
said the little girl,
who was reluctant to disobey her little friends 
 If you promised not to open up to strangers,
then of course you can't buy 
You are a good girl indeed! 
Then the old woman went on,
 And as a reward for being good,
I'm going to gift you one of my apples! 
Without a further thought,
Snow White opened the door just a tiny crack,
to take the the apple 
The moment she bit into the fruit,
she was affected by the poison and fell down as if dead 
Now chuckling wickedly,
the Queen hurried off to the palace 
She was delighted that day when she looked in her mirror and asked,
 Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who is the fairest one of all? 
and the mirror repiled,
 You, O Queen,
are the fairest one of all  
The dwarfs worried about Snow White all day 
In the evening,
after work,
they ran as quickly as they could,
down the mountain to their cottage 
They found Snow White,
lying still and lifeless with the poisoned apple by her side 
They did their best to bring her back to life,
but it was of no use 
They wept bitterly for a long time 
Then they laid her in a coffin and placed a glass lid over the top so that all could admire her beauty,
even though she was dead 
They carried the coffin to the top of a hill where they took turns to stand guard 
A few days later,
a Prince who was riding through the forest came to the hill where Snow White lay in her glass-topped coffin 
She looked so beautiful that he fell in love with her at once 
He asked the dwarfs if he might have the coffin and take it to his castle 
The dwarfs would not allow him to do so,
but they did let the Prince kiss her 
As the Prince kissed Snow White gently,
he moved her head 
The Piece of poisoned apple fell from her lips 
Slowly she came back to life 
Snow White opened her eyes and saw the handsome Prince kneeling on the ground beside her 
She fell in love with him instantly 
The Queen,
far away in the castle,
could not believe her ears when she heard her mirros say,
 You, O Queen,
are fair,
tis true, but Snow White is still fairer than you  
By now,
the king had also discovered what mischief she had been up to,
and Banished her from his land 
No one ever saw her or her mirror again 
As for Snow White,
the Prince asked her to marry him and the seven dwarfs reluctantly had to bid good bye to her 
At the Prince's castle,
Snow White and the Prince were married,
and they both lived happily ever after 
The Little Mice and the Big Elephant
once upon a time
a village was ruinwd by a strong earthquake 
The houses and roads got totally damaged 
Is this yours, Tom?
Is your gun loaded?
Is your room clean?
Isn't Tom handsome?
Isn't Tom with you?
Isn't his name Tom?
Isn't it delicious?
Isn't she a doctor?
Isn't that curious?
Isn't that obvious?
Isn't this amazing?
It all makes sense 
It almost happened 
It came to nothing 
It can be repaired 
It can't be helped 
It can't get worse 
It changed my life 
It could be a hoax 
It could be a trap 
It could be anyone 
It couldn't be Tom 
It didn't end well 
It does get easier 
It has to be there 
It helped me a lot 
It hurt really bad 
It is Monday today 
It is a black hole 
It is a long story 
It is almost three 
It is already dark 
It is cloudy today 
It is cold outside 
It is dark outside 
It is his decision 
It is of great use 
It is raining hard 
It is too long ago 
It isn't like that 
It keeps happening 
It looks delicious 
It looks like rain 
It looks like snow 
It looks very good 
It might be a trap 
It must be removed 
It rained for days 
It really happened 
It saved our lives 
It seems worthless 
It smells like Tom 
It snowed for days 
It sounds familiar 
It sounds like Tom 
It started to rain 
It started to snow 
It turned out well 
It was Tom's fault 
It was a bad movie 
It was a dream job 
It was a fun night 
It was a good idea 
It was a nightmare 
It was all planned 
It was complicated 
It was easy to fix 
It was handcrafted 
It was in the news 
It was in this box 
It was just a joke 
It was just a kiss 
It was just stupid 
It was mesmerizing 
It was my decision 
It was nearly noon 
It was only a joke 
It was preventable 
It was quiet again 
It was quite funny 
It was really good 
It was still there 
It was that simple 
It was their fault 
It was unavoidable 
It was very simple 
It was worth a try 
It wasn't personal 
It wasn't very fun 
It won't last long 
It won't take long 
It'll be a big day 
It'll be dark soon 
It'll be over soon 
It'll have to wait 
It'll never happen 
It'll soon be dark 
It's Tom, isn't it?
It's a Cuban cigar 
It's a French word 
It's a bad example 
It's a big company 
It's a cruel world 
It's a good policy 
It's a good school 
It's a lot of work 
It's a proven fact 
It's a stupid idea 
It's a stupid rule 
It's a typo  Sorry 
It's a vague story 
It's all our fault 
It's all up to you 
It's almost summer 
It's already seven 
It's at the corner 
It's badly damaged 
It's beautiful out 
It's big, isn't it?
It's cold out here 
It's far from here 
It's far from over 
It's far too small 
It's for my family 
It's fun to travel 
It's getting worse 
It's going to rain 
It's good training 
It's gotten better 
It's hot down here 
It's in the fridge 
It's just not fair 
It's just too soon 
It's kind of funny 
It's me again, Tom 
It's my first time 
It's my last offer 
It's nice and cool 
It's nice and warm 
It's not a problem 
It's not important 
It's not like that 
It's not safe here 
It's not that cold 
It's not up to you 
It's not very good 
It's now your turn 
It's pretty simple 
It's probably true 
It's raining again!
It's raining there 
It's raining today 
It's rather unique 
It's really simple 
It's rude to stare 
It's sad, but true 
It's snowing there 
It's snowing today 
It's so impersonal 
It's started again 
It's still crowded 
It's still raining 
It's still snowing 
It's time to leave 
It's time to party 
It's time to sleep 
It's too dangerous 
It's too difficult 
It's too expensive 
It's totally wrong 
It's unforgettable 
It's very alarming 
It's very cold now 
It's very hot here 
It's well worth it 
It's your decision 
Italy is in Europe 
Italy isn't Greece 
Jam comes in a jar 
Judge for yourself 
Just do what I say 
Just don't drop it 
Just give it a try 
Just say yes or no 
Just start talking 
Just throw it away 
Just water, please 
Keep an eye on Tom 
Keep an eye on him 
Keep your promises 
Laws are necessary 
Leave my car alone 
Let Tom do his job 
Let go of the rope 
Let him pay for it 
Let me explain why 
Let me go with you 
Let me handle this 
Let me have a look 
Let me look at you 
Let me pay tonight 
Let me take a look 
Let us do the work 
Let's buy this one 
Let's get divorced 
Let's get off here 
Let's go home, Tom 
Let's hit the sack 
Let's just go home 
Let's meet at 2:30 
Let's meet at 6:30 
Let's skip dessert 
Let's speak French 
Let's stay focused 
Let's study French 
Let's take a break 
Let's take a train 
Let's take the bus 
Let's talk outside 
Let's wait a while 
Let's write a book 
Life is very short 
Listen, all of you 
Look at my new car 
Look at that house 
Look at this stuff 
Look at your hands 
Look up at the sky 
Look what I caught 
Look what happened 
Look! She's coming!
Look, it's snowing!
Love doesn't exist 
Love is in the air 
Love is not enough 
Luckily, it worked 
Make it short, Tom 
Make love, not war 
Mary has nice legs 
Mary iced the cake 
Mary is Tom's wife 
Mary is a bad girl 
Mary is a waitress 
Mary is attractive 
Mary was beautiful 
May God reward you 
May I call you Tom?
May I have a drink?
May I pay by check?
May I run with you?
May I speak to Tom?
May I speak to you?
May I take a photo?
May I use this pen?
Maybe Tom is lying 
Maybe he likes you 
Maybe it will snow 
Maybe they're busy 
Maybe you're right 
Meet me in an hour 
Monday's a holiday 
My answer is final 
My arm still hurts 
My battery is dead 
My boots are muddy 
My car is a Toyota 
My car won't start 
My dad just called 
My door was closed 
My dream came true 
My dress is ruined 
My eyes feel itchy 
My family is small 
My father was busy 
My friend was shot 
My garden is small 
My hair's too long 
My hands were full 
My house is a mess 
My husband is lazy 
My knife is broken 
My legs feel heavy 
My legs still hurt 
My lips are sealed 
My mind is a blank 
My mind was racing 
My mother is angry 
My mother loves me 
My name's Tom, too 
My nose is running 
My parents are old 
My parents love me 
My right leg hurts 
My socks are dirty 
My stomach growled 
My stomach is full 
My turn comes next 
My watch is broken 
My watch says 2:30 
My wife cooks well 
My wife is cooking 
My window was open 
Need anything else?
Never ever give up 
Never give up hope 
No one believed me 
No one believes me 
No one can help us 
No one can stop me 
No one looks happy 
No one noticed Tom 
No one saw a thing 
No one was at home 
No one's been hurt 
No one's listening 
Nobody believes me 
Nobody can help me 
Nobody can stop me!
Nobody noticed Tom 
Nobody volunteered 
Nobody walks in LA 
Nobody wants a war 
Nobody watches her 
Nobody will notice 
Nothing is forever 
Nothing is missing 
Nothing is perfect 
Nothing is working 
Nothing's going on 
Now I'm wide awake 
Now it is official 
Now it's your turn 
Obey your teachers 
Once is not enough 
One of us is wrong 
Open your suitcase 
Our cat is missing 
Our project failed 
Owls have big eyes 
Owls hunt at night 
Paper burns easily 
Peel the cucumbers 
People are strange 
People are talking 
People like my mom 
Pick me up at 2:30 
Pick up your trash 
Please call a taxi 
Please call him up 
Please call me Tom 
Please come inside 
Please do as I say 
Please do that now 
Please don't do it 
Please don't shoot 
Please get dressed 
Please give me one 
Please have a seat 
Please let me know 
Please let us know 
Please look for it 
Please make my bed 
Please sing a song 
Please step inside 
Please stop crying 
Please take a bath 
Please take a seat 
Please wait for me 
Prices have jumped 
Put away your toys 
Put down the knife 
Put the book there 
Put your helmet on 
Read it to me, Tom 
Real men drink tea 
Relax for a second 
Remove that jacket 
Return immediately 
Run for your lives!
Save it till later 
Save your strength 
School is over now 
Schools are closed 
Schools were built 
See you guys later 
See you in October

Shake before using 
Shall we stop soon?
She almost drowned 
She always says no 
She ate her dinner 
She began to sweat 
She bought chicken 
She broke my heart 
She came to my aid 
She came to see me 
She cannot stop it 
She cannot stop me 
She cannot stop us 
She could not swim 
She did a good job 
She didn't show up 
She died yesterday 
She does not smoke 
She gave it to him 
She gave me a doll 
She goes to school 
She had no brother 
She has even teeth 
She has green eyes 
She has more books 
She has no enemies 
She has no manners 
She has seven sons 
She has short hair 
She has small feet 
She has three kids 
She heard him sing 
She invited him in 
She is a poor cook 
She is a sorceress 
She is always busy 
She is an American 
She is from France 
She is helping him 
She is kind to him 
She is kissing him 
She is over twenty 
She is quite angry 
She is teaching me 
She is unconscious 
She is very bright 
She is very pretty 
She isn't here now 
She kept on crying 
She left for Paris 
She likes sleeping 
She listens to him 
She lives in Kyoto 
She lives with him 
She looked excited 
She looks confused 
She looks lonesome 
She loves antiques 
She loves children 
She loves shopping 
She made him do it 
She made him happy 
She made me a cake 
She makes me happy 
She needs our help 
She picked flowers 
She pointed at him 
She probably knows 
She put on her hat 
She sat next to me 
She shook her head 
She smiled happily 
She speaks Chinese 
She speaks Russian 
She speaks quickly 
She threatened him 
She wants to dance 
She was all smiles 
She was born blind 
She was born lucky 
She was in a hurry 
She was laughed at 
She was making tea 
She will come soon 
She's Tom's sister 
She's a smart girl 
She's an alcoholic 
She's at a meeting 
She's eating fruit 
She's my classmate 
She's my godmother 
She's my professor 
She's not a doctor 
She's only a child 
She's thirty-three 
Should we call Tom?

Tell me your names 
Tell us what to do 
Thank you for that 
Thank you for this 
Thank you, my dear 
Thanks for helping 
Thanks for the tip 
That belongs to me 
That belongs to us 
That book is small 
That can't be true 
That feels amazing 
That guy annoys me 
That happened here 
That house is mine 
That is not my pen 
That is our father 
That is our school 
That is surprising 
That isn't a tiger 
That job paid well 
That made me laugh 
That man ate bread 
That might be true 
That never changes 
That seat is taken 
That sounds stupid 
That surprised Tom 
That was a mistake 
That was delicious 
That was different 
That was hilarious 
That was my finger 
That was very easy 
That was very good 
That was years ago 
That won't be easy 
That would be fine 
That would be good 
That would be nice 
That'll have to do 
That's OK with Tom 
That's Tom's horse 
That's Tom's house 
That's Tom's watch 
That's a good idea!
That's a good idea 
That's a good plan 
That's a man's job 
That's a nice coat 
That's a nice song 
That's a total lie 
That's all we know 
That's an old joke 
That's even better 
That's fair enough 
That's good advice 
That's hard to say 
That's how life is 
That's interesting 
That's just as bad 
That's my suitcase 
That's no surprise 
That's not a tiger 
That's not allowed 
That's not for Tom 
That's not for you 
That's not my name 
That's nothing new 
That's one of mine 
That's one of ours 
That's our problem 
That's really cute 
That's so annoying 
That's the biggest 
That's the trigger 
That's unfortunate 
That's unimportant 
That's very simple 
That's what I hope 
That's what I like 
That's what I said 
That's what I want 
That's what we saw 
That's why Tom won 
The alarm went off 
The answer was yes 
The apples are red 
The attempt failed 
The baby is asleep 
The baby is crying 
The baby was naked 
The battery's dead 
The bird flew away 
The boy is jumping 
The boy is thirsty 
The boy was silent 
The boys are noisy 
The bread is fresh 
The car broke down 
The car hit a tree 
The case is closed 
The clock is wrong 
The coffee's ready 
The concert's over 
The crow flew away 
The disco is empty 
The dog is barking 
The dog is jumping 
The dog looks sick 
The dog seems sick 
The door is locked 
The doorknob broke 
The dress is green 
The earth is round 
The economy is bad 
The flame went out 
The floor is dirty 
The floor was cold 
The fog has lifted 
The fruit went bad 
The girl is lonely 
The girls gossiped 
The glass is clean 
The glass is dirty 
The glass is empty 
The house caved in 
The ice has melted 
The ice is melting 
The idea isn't bad 
The idea isn't new 
The knife is dirty 
The law is the law 
The light is green 
The light went out 
The lights are out 
The lock is broken 
The meat is frozen 
The men are coming 
The men go to work 
The moon is bright 
The movie was good 
The night was cool 
The ocean was calm 
The only way is up 
The others laughed 
The pan is too hot 
The paper is white 
The park was empty 
The parrot is dead 
The plate is dirty 
The pond is frozen 
The race was fixed 
The road is closed 
The rock feels wet 
The room was empty 
The room was quiet 
The ship is at sea 
The sky brightened 
The soldiers fired 
The spider is dead 
The spoon is dirty 
The stars came out 
The store's closed 
The story was true 
The summer is over 
The sun is setting 
The sun is shining 
The sun was bright 
The table is green 
The thief ran away 
The thief ran fast 
The tire leaks air 
The tree fell down 
The water is clean 
The water was cold 
The water was warm 
The waves are high 
The window is open 
The woman is naked 
The wood is rotten 
The world is small 
Then what happened?
There are no rules 
There goes our bus 
There is one catch 
There is some wind 
There's a big hole 
There's no mistake 
There's no urgency 
There's no way out 
There's still hope 
There's still time 
These are my books 
These aren't words 
These came for you 
These cars are big 
These dogs are big 
They abandoned Tom 
They adopted a kid 
They all have come 
They all looked up 
They are both good 
They are impatient 
They are not tired 
They aren't hungry 
They aren't stupid 
They asked me here 
They can't do this 
They can't get out 
They can't hurt me 
They can't see Tom 
They can't see you 
They can't stop me 
They didn't listen 
They didn't pay me 
They don't know me 
They don't know us 
They don't like me 
They don't want it 
They don't want us 
They found nothing 
They gave it to me 
They have families 
They know about it 
They know who I am 
They laughed at me 
They left me alone 
They look confused 
They look relieved 
They looked around 
They made me do it 
They make me laugh 
They met in secret 
They must be happy 
They never give up 
They never stopped 
They really did it 
They say he's sick 
They spoke briefly 
They understand us 
They walked around 
They want you dead 
They were attacked 
They were fearless 
They were murdered 
They were sleeping 
They were soldiers 
They were swimming 
They were tortured 
They weren't there 
They won that game 
They won't be shot 
They won't find it 
They won't hurt us 
They won't make it 
They work at night 
They'll be pleased 
They'll come to us 
They'll understand 
They're all guilty 
They're carnations 
They're doing fine 
They're everywhere 
They're foreigners 
They're in the car 
They're leaving us 
They're mad at you 
They're my cousins 
They're not coming 
They're not stupid 
They're part of us 
They're unreliable 
They're very happy 
They're yours, Tom 
They've fooled you 
They've lied to me 
Think about it, OK?

I don't feel like eating anything today 
I don't feel like speaking French today 
I don't feel like studying French today 
I don't feel like telling her the truth 
I don't feel that way about you anymore 
I don't for a moment doubt your honesty 
I don't go camping as much as I used to 
I don't go fishing as much as I used to 
I don't go hiking as often as I used to 
I don't have a bicycle, let alone a car 
I don't have an office in this building 
I don't have as much money as you think 
I don't have enough money at the moment 
I don't have the time to read this book 
I don't have time to help you right now 
I don't intend to go to Boston with you 
I don't know Tom, but I know his sister 
I don't know how many years I have left 
I don't know how to interpret his words 
I don't know how to translate this word 
I don't know if that's such a good idea 
I don't know the exact place I was born 
I don't know this neighborhood too well 
I don't know what I'm going to tell Tom 
I don't know what Tom is planning to do 
I don't know what has become of the boy 
I don't know where Tom put his suitcase 
I don't know where Tom put my suitcases 
I don't know whether Tom is busy or not 
I don't know whether it's going to work 
I don't know whether to tell Tom or not 
I don't know why you want me to do that 
I don't like being asked to go shopping 
I don't like being treated like a child 
I don't like it when my shoes get dirty 
I don't like this paper  It's too shiny 
I don't like your coming late every day 
I don't plan on going anywhere tomorrow 
I don't plan to meet Tom until tomorrow 
I don't read as many books as I used to 
I don't really want to be all by myself 
I don't regret what happened last night 
I don't remember what I was looking for 
I don't remember where I put my glasses 
I don't see any point in persuading him 
I don't think I can do this without Tom 
I don't think I can do this without you 
I don't think Tom has any classes today 
I don't think Tom has very long to live 
I don't think anyone was here yesterday 
I don't think it'll rain this afternoon 
I don't think it's any of your business 
I don't think much of him as a musician 
I don't think that would be a good idea 
I don't think that's why Tom isn't here 
I don't think your father would approve 
I don't think your mother would approve 
I don't understand his reluctance to go 
I don't understand this question at all 
I don't understand what's bothering you 
I don't understand your sudden interest 
I don't usually eat at places like this 
I don't usually have to work on Sundays 
I don't usually write this kind of song 
I don't want Tom to know that right now 
I don't want anyone to see me like this 
I don't want to buy that house from him 
I don't want to ever speak to you again 
I don't want to sit next to Tom tonight 
I don't want to talk about it right now 
I don't want to talk about this anymore 
I don't want to tell my girlfriend that 
I downloaded the file that Tom uploaded 
I dreamed I had been abducted by aliens 
I erased the blackboard for the teacher 
I feed my dog meat at least once a week 
I feel a great love for all of humanity 
I feel worse today than I did yesterday 
I fell asleep while studying at my desk 
I felt exhausted when the game was over 
I find her manner a little hard to take 
I forgot to put a stamp on the envelope 
I found it difficult to use the machine 
I found it easy to operate the computer 
I found the picture Tom was looking for 
I gave a speech at Tom's birthday party 
I gave up on the idea of buying a house 
I got a new hat at the department store 
I got back to Boston early this morning 
I got my right leg hurt in the accident 
I got out of my car and closed the door 
I got the information from him directly 
I got to know Tom when I was in college 
I got up early to catch the first train 
I had a cup of tea to keep myself awake 
I had a hard time making both ends meet 
I had little time to prepare the speech 
I had my brother put this room in order 
I had my house painted not too long ago 
I had never seen a more beautiful sight 
I had never seen a panda till that time 
I had no choice but to accept the offer 
I had no idea you couldn't speak French 
I had some trouble in finding his house 
I had the brakes of my bicycle adjusted 
I happened to be in Boston at that time 
I hate it when people smoke in my house 
I have a brother who lives in Australia 
I have a feeling that she'll come today 
I have a patient who's in a lot of pain 
I have a problem and I need your advice 
I have been living here for three years 
I have breakfast at seven every morning 
I have different priorities than you do 
I have heard this story scores of times 
I have no idea what Tom was looking for 
I have no idea who you're talking about 
I have no words to express my gratitude 
I have nothing else scheduled for today 
I have nothing to do with this accident 
I have some good news and some bad news 
I have spent a lot of money on my house 
I have ten times more books than you do 
I have three times as many books as Tom 
I have three times as many books as him 
I have three times as much money as you 
I have to answer this letter right away 
I have to be in Boston by 2:30 tomorrow 
I have to burn the midnight oil tonight 
I have to buy flowers for my girlfriend 
I have to change a string on the guitar 
I have to give a class tomorrow at 2:30 
I have to think about the possibilities 
I have to try a little harder next time 
I have trouble taking powdered medicine 
I haven't gotten rid of my bad cold yet 
I haven't yet asked Tom for his opinion 
I hear he has been ill since last month 
I hear that Tom and Mary have broken up 
I hear you've been pretty busy yourself 
I heard Tom and Mary talking about John 
I heard that Tom used to live in Boston 
I hesitated to go to the movie with him 
I hope Tom comes over to my place today 
I hope Tom likes the gift we bought him 
I hope everything's going well with you 
I hope that Mary passes the examination 
I hope this doesn't ruin our friendship 
I hope we will be able to keep in touch 
I hope you had a good time at the party 
I hope you'll come to my birthday party 
I just can't overlook his rude behavior 
I just did what the boss asked me to do 
I just want to improve as much as I can 
I just wanted to see if I could do that 
I kept asking myself why I'm doing this 
I knew Tom wasn't going to wait for you 
I know I shouldn't care what Tom thinks 
I know Spanish, Basque and some English 
I know Tom better than anyone else does 
I know Tom better than he knows himself 
I know Tom can't speak French very well 
I know how to swim, but I don't like to 
I know it sounds strange, but it's true 
I know of her, but I have never met her 
I know that Tom can do that if he tries 
I know that Tom can't understand French 
I know that Tom does that every morning 
I know that Tom was at your house today 
I know the person you are talking about 
I know the reason that she quit her job 
I know the reason, but I can't tell you 
I know what it's like to be the new guy 
I know where you were yesterday evening 
I know you considered me a close friend 
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower 
I like skiing much better than swimming 
I like the smell of freshly-baked bread 
I like to shop at that department store 
I like to take my children to the beach 
I like white roses better than red ones 
I liked the room overlooking the valley 
I live very close to the subway station 
I live within 200 meters of the station 
I lived in the Rhineland for many years 
I look forward to hearing from you soon 
I look forward to seeing you again soon 
I lost the watch that my father gave me 
I love the smell of freshly baked bread 
I love you all the more for your faults 
I loved to climb trees when I was a kid 
I manage to get along on a small salary 
I managed to get to the station on time 
I met her in the winter three years ago 
I might be able to answer that question 
I must finish my homework before dinner 
I must sell my farm to pay off my debts 
I mustered up my courage and went there 
I need a little time to reflect upon it 
I need a pencil  Can I use one of yours?
I need someone to translate this for me 
I need someone who I can feel safe with 
I never had the chance to talk with Tom 
I never imagined I'd be working for you 
I never said that it wasn't a good idea 
I never said that to you or anyone else 
I never thought I'd see Tom alive again 
I never thought I'd see you alive again 
I noticed that she sat in the front row 
I offered to help her with her homework 
I often run into her at the supermarket 
I only asked if I could borrow the book 
I only eat like this when I'm miserable 
I permitted Tom to camp in our backyard 
I plan to leave Boston as soon as I can 
I plan to stay at home all day tomorrow 
I pretended to believe what Tom told me 
I probably would've done the same thing 
I promise you that I'll do that for you 
I promised to read the report carefully 
I really don't know how I can thank you 
I really wasn't expecting that from you 
I received a letter in French last week 
I saw him at the station a few days ago 
I saw the film and found it interesting 
I should just tell Tom I made a mistake 
I should've told you everything earlier 
I simply cannot put up with her manners 
I slipped on my geta and dashed outside 
I speak French much better than English 
I spent a couple of months in Australia 
I spent the whole day cleaning my house 
I still have a score to settle with him 
I still have to fix the washing machine 
I still prefer to write letters by hand 
I suggest that the meeting be postponed 
I suggested that the meeting be put off 
I sure wish I could speak French better 
I suspect that Tom is in love with Mary 
I swear that I'll never do such a thing 
I swear to you I will never do it again 
I take my dog for a walk, rain or shine 
I thank you from the bottom of my heart 
I think I caught a bug over the weekend 
I think I'll take Tom to Boston with me 
I think Tom has never been to Australia 
I think Tom is hiding something from me 
I think Tom wants something to write on 
I think honesty will pay off in the end 
I think it'd be great if you could come 
I think it's about time for us to leave 
I think it's cruel to keep a cat inside 
I think it's time for me to buy a house 
I think it's time for me to change jobs 
I think it's time to try a new approach 
I think it's time you and Tom went home 
I think that Tom and Mary aren't biased 
I think that honesty is the best policy 
I think that's impossible in Tom's case 
I think they're trying to intimidate us 
I think this is what you're looking for 
I think we are happier than most people 
I think we need to postpone the meeting 
I think we should do what Tom suggested 
I think we're going on vacation in June 
I think what you just told me was a lie 
I think you should work a little harder 
I think you'll find it very interesting 
I think you're both pretty good-looking 
I think you're drinking out of my glass 
I think you're going to like this movie 
I think your English has improved a lot 
I thought I'd never hear from you again 
I thought I'd never see you alive again 
I thought Tom had something to tell you 
I thought about what you said yesterday 
I thought clothes would be cheaper here 
I thought she didn't look a day over 30 
I thought that Tom had done that for us 
I thought that you were living with Tom 
I thought we agreed we wouldn't do this 
I thought we were going to go somewhere 
I thought you had an agreement with Tom 
I thought you might be too busy to help 
I thought you might know where Tom went 
I thought you said I could count on you 
I thought you said Tom was your brother 
I thought you said nobody knew about us 
I thought you said you didn't trust Tom 
I thought you were a decent young woman 
I thought you were going to wait for me 
I thought you would find it interesting 
I told Tom I'd pick him up after school 
I took an airplane from Tokyo to Kyushu 
I took the elevator to the fourth floor 
I tried calling, but they didn't answer 
I tried to get in touch with the police 
I tried to persuade Tom, but I couldn't 
I turned off the lamp and went to sleep 
I used a computer in order to save time 
I used to enjoy playing tennis with Tom 
I used to play alone when I was a child 
I usually go to the barber once a month 
I visited Tom in Boston three years ago 
I visited the village where he was born 
I waited all morning for that to happen 
I waited for her for a really long time 
I walk my dog in the park every morning 
I want some answers and I want them now 
I want the whole world to know about us 
I want to do what's best for both of us 
I want to get better at speaking French 
I want to know what's going on out here 
I want to lie down and rest for a while 
I want to see you two in my office  Now 
I want to send these letters by airmail 
I want to visit Cuba before Castro dies 
I want you to not go to Boston with Tom 
I was afraid of what people would think 
I was already busy planning my vacation 
I was annoyed that she was still asleep 
I was astonished to hear that he failed 
I was caught in a shower on my way home 
I was deeply impressed with his courage 
I was disappointed with the new product 
I was fifteen years old in this picture 
I was getting used to living in America 
I was hit by a car in Boston last month 
I was not pleased by your rude behavior 
I was profoundly disturbed by this news 
I was raised on the east side of Boston 
I was saving this piece of cake for you 
I was starting to think you'd forgotten 
I was suddenly awakened by a loud noise 
I was very tired so I went to bed early 
I wasn't able to do that as fast as Tom 
I wasn't sure if I was going to make it 
I wasn't the only one who made promises 
I went to Sendai and hurried right back 
I went to bed a little later than usual 
I went to bed early because I was tired 
I went to the airport to meet my father 
I will be leaving for Morocco next week 
I will be traveling in Europe next week 
I will give you whatever is in this box 
I will overlook your lateness this time 
I will personally be responsible for it 
I will see him at the first opportunity 
I will spend next Sunday reading novels 
I will take the next plane for New York 
I will write down your name and address 
I wish I could go to the party with you 
I wish I could have spoken more English 
I wish I could help you find a good job 
I wish I could spend more time with you 
I wish I could stay here with you today 
I wish I had more time to talk with you 
I wish I hadn't gotten married so young 
I wish I'd been smart enough to do that 
I wish I'd done what Tom suggested I do 
I wish somebody would help me with that 
I wish the circumstances were different 
I wish you both a lifetime of happiness 
I wish you'd quit throwing things at me 
I wish you'd told me that a bit earlier 
I won't give up, no matter what you say 
I won't rest until I find out the truth 
I wonder if Tom ever gives Mary flowers 
I wonder if it really was a coincidence 
I wonder what Tom will order for dinner 
I wonder what goes on inside Tom's head 
I wonder what the next question will be 
I wonder when the rainy season will end 
I wonder where your brother has gone to 
I wonder whether Tom likes Chinese food 
I wonder who's going to be at the party 
I wonder why eggs are sold by the dozen 
I wonder why it's so crowded here today 
I worked three years as Tom's assistant 
I would do that right now if I were you 
I would like to do something else today 
I would like to marry somebody like her 
I would like to open a checking account 
I would like to speak to the head nurse 
I would like to travel around the world 
I would like you to introduce me to her 
I would rather let him have his own way 
I would rather quit than work under him 
I would've shown you how to do it right 
I wouldn't dream of letting you do that 
I wouldn't have done that if I were you 
I wouldn't want you to think I was mean 
I'd appreciate any help you can give me 
I'd be delighted if that happened again 
I'd hate to be in Tom's shoes right now 
I'd like to discuss this with your boss 
I'd like to find out why Tom lied to me 
I'd like to have a little chat with you 
I'd like to have a little talk with you 
I'd like to introduce you to my parents 
I'd like to know how to paint like that 
I'd like to learn how to play the banjo 
I'd like to mail this package to Canada 
I'd like to see that in black and white 
I'd like to send a coded message to Tom 
I'd rather stay at home than go fishing 
I'd rather you came tomorrow than today 
I'd strongly advise against going there 
I'd very much like to know your opinion 
I'll arrive on the twentieth of October 
I'll ask Tom to carry this box upstairs 
I'll be at home the next time she comes 
I'll be in bed by the time you get home 
I'll be in the next room if you need me 
I'll call you when I get to the station 
I'll come and see you one of these days 
I'll come without fail tomorrow morning 
I'll do that later when I'm not so busy 
I'll explain the matter to you later on 
I'll give you an answer in a day or two 
I'll go tomorrow if the weather is good 
I'll have someone show you to your room 
I'll keep this piece of cake for myself 
I'll leave it to you to buy the tickets 
I'll let you know if Tom shows up early 
I'll never set foot in this house again 
I'll see what I can do, but no promises 
I'll stand guard now  Go get some sleep 
I'll stay here if you really want me to 
I'll stay in Australia for three months 
I'll take care of the dog till tomorrow 
I'll take care of your children tonight 
I'll talk with you about this later, OK?
I'll talk with you when you're not busy 
I'll try not to make mistakes next time 
I'll wait for you in the hotel tomorrow 
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan 
I'm afraid I can't make it at that time 
I'm afraid that's easier said than done 
I'm almost never at home during the day 
I'm being criticized for not doing more 
I'm certain that Tom will pass the exam 
I'm definitely not going back to Boston 
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance 
I'm doing a lot more now than I used to 
I'm drunk, but I can still speak German 
I'm fairly confident that I can do that 
I'm far from happy about this situation 
I'm free all afternoon on February 27th 
I'm going fishing with Tom next weekend 
I'm going to Australia again next month 
I'm going to go tomorrow no matter what 
I'm going to make Tom some chicken soup 
I'm going to need at least five minutes 
I'm going to rip up this piece of paper 
I'm going to spend the evening with Tom 
I'm going to stay here for several days 
I'm grateful for everything you've done 
I'm happy to finally meet you in person 
I'm hoping Tom learns from his mistakes 
I'm just saying you shouldn't trust Tom 
I'm looking for a present for my mother 
I'm looking forward to doing this again 
I'm looking forward to hearing from you 
I'm looking forward to seeing you again 
I'm looking forward to seeing you dance 
I'm looking forward to working with you 
I'm not able to translate this sentence 
I'm not as big a fool as you think I am 
I'm not as good a French teacher as Tom 
I'm not going to go to Boston next week 
I'm not going to let you boss me around 
I'm not in the habit of staying up late 
I'm not in the mood to go out right now 
I'm not satisfied with your explanation 
I'm not sure I understand what you mean 
I'm not sure if Tom wants to talk to me 
I'm not sure if Tom will like this idea 
I'm not sure what else I can do for you 
I'm not sure whether I really want that 
I'm not the only one who got here early 
I'm officially protesting this decision 
I'm old enough to make my own decisions 
I'm only doing it because I'm forced to 
I'm planning to go to bed early tonight 
I'm pretty sure Tom is right about that 
I'm pretty sure he came late on purpose 
I'm proud that my father is a good cook 
I'm proud to be working on this project 
I'm ready to admit that it was my fault 
I'm really bad at doing stuff like this 
I'm sick of listening to her complaints 
I'm so sorry  I didn't mean to kick you 
I'm sorry I don't have my watch with me 
I'm sorry I've kept you waiting so long 
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday 
I'm sorry for all the pain I caused you 
I'm sorry that I can't meet you tonight 
I'm sorry you got dragged into all this 
I'm sorry, but I'll have to go home now 
I'm sorry, but it's really not possible 
I'm sorry  That's really all I remember 
I'm supposed to help Tom clean his room 
I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before 
I'm sure that's not what you want to do 
I'm sure they'll be very happy together 
I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding 
I'm surprised that Tom isn't here today 
I'm the one who deserves to be promoted 
I'm the second oldest of three children 
I'm tired of working a nine-to-five job 
I'm too busy to talk with Tom right now 
I'm used to being ignored by my parents 
I'm used to people not agreeing with me 
I'm very sorry for causing the accident 
I've already finished reading this book 
I've already seen Tom about that matter 
I've been looking for a job a long time 
I've been put in charge of this project 
I've been sick in bed since last Monday 
I've been trying to reach you for hours 
I've crossed the Atlantic several times 
I've decided not to swim this afternoon 
I've given this a great deal of thought 
I've got a funny feeling about that guy 
I've got a little surprise for you, Tom 
I've got a lot more experience than Tom 
I've got as much to lose here as you do 
I've got mosquito bites all over my arm 
I've just received some delightful news 
I've kind of gotten used to the weather 
I've never fallen in love with any girl 
I've never met a Canadian I didn't like 
I've never seen such a beautiful sunset 
I've ordered two teas and three coffees 
I've read only the first three chapters 
I've rented a room in Paris for a month 
I've seen Tom do some remarkable things 
I've wanted to meet him for a long time 
I've wanted to meet you for a long time 
I've written part of the report already 
If I had a son, I wouldn't name him Tom 
If I were healthy, I could go on a hike 
If I were you, I wouldn't live with him 
If I won the lottery, I'd buy you a car 
If I'd wanted to go, I would've said so 
If Tom is here, you don't need to worry 
If it rains tomorrow, I'll stay at home 
If life deals you lemons, make lemonade 
If life gives you lemons, make lemonade 
If looks could kill, I'd be dead by now 
If today was Sunday, I would go fishing 
If you don't do that, Tom will be upset 
If you don't go skiing, I won't, either 
If you go fishing tomorrow, I will, too 
If you mix blue and red, you get violet 
If you need my help, please let me know 
If you speak French, I won't understand 
If you want a pencil, I'll lend you one 
In English the verb precedes the object 
In German, nouns are always capitalised 
In Japan, it's three in the morning now 
In a few years, we'll all be doing that 
In autumn, leaves change color and fall 
In the summer, people go to the seaside 
Instead of stopping, the rain increased 
Is English more difficult than Japanese?
Is French a difficult language to learn?
Is aggression natural, or is it learned?
Is he really the man you're looking for?
Is it always wrong to take a human life?
Is it true that Tom can't read or write?
Is it true that you and Tom got married?
Is it true that you were in Madrid then?
Is it true you're a high school teacher?
Is the tap water in Australia drinkable?
Is there a garden in front of the house?
Is there a place we can speak privately?
Is there any reason why I must obey him?
Is there any trace of the missing child?
Is there anyone you'd like us to notify?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Is there anything that I can do for you?
Is there anything that needs to be done?
Is there anything you'd like to tell me?
Is your school far away from your house?
It all comes down to a question of time 
It became clear that she had told a lie 
It concerns all the people living there 
It doesn't look like it's going to rain 
It doesn't mean what you think it means 
It happened that we were in London then 
It has been 200 years since Mozart died 
It has been raining since last Thursday 
It has developed into a very large city 
It is a disease that can't be prevented 
It is certainly possible if you want it 
It is cheaper than chemical fertilizers 
It is easy to tell him from his brother 
It is necessary for you to stop smoking 
It is necessary for you to study harder 
It is no use trying to solve the riddle 
It is not easy to get rid of bad habits 
It is possible that he is telling a lie 
It is quality, not quantity that counts 
It is stupid of him to behave like that 
It is very cold here all the year round 
It isn't likely Tom did that on purpose 
It looks like Tom is flirting with Mary 
It looks like today is not my lucky day 
It looks like we both had the same idea 
It never stopped raining the entire day 
It seems that the store is closed today 
It should only take a couple of minutes 
It so happens that today is my birthday 
It took Tom thirty minutes to get there 
It took a little longer than I expected 
It took her a long time to choose a hat 
It took me three days to clean the room 
It took me three days to read this book 
It usually has just the opposite effect 
It was a long time since I've done that 
It was a ship with a crew of 25 sailors 
It was believed that the earth was flat 
It was dark and I couldn't see anything 
It was found at the bottom of the river 
It was obvious that they had told a lie 
It was pure chance that he won the game 
It was silly of him to refuse her offer 
It was so cold that the lake froze over 
It was wise of him to take his umbrella 
It wasn't as cheap as I thought it'd be 
It will cost more than ten thousand yen 
It will not be long before spring comes 
It would be best if I met him in person 
It would be better if you went by train 
It wouldn't take long for us to do that 
It'd be better if you didn't come today 
It'll cost about 2,000 yen to repair it 
It'll save time if we avoid Park Street 
It's Tom's turn to help wash the dishes 
It's Tom's turn to take out the garbage 
It's a good idea to drink bottled water 
It's a pity that you should leave Japan 
It's a pity you don't know how to dance 
It's a situation I would love to change 
It's a waste of time to wait any longer

Yesterday a truck hit this wall 
Yesterday my uncle bought a dog 
Yesterday, I cooked Okonomiyaki 
Yesterday, he told me the truth 
You all remember Tom, don't you?
You always order the same thing 
You always take things too easy 
You are a good cook, aren't you?
You are always as busy as a bee 
You are in very serious trouble 
You are not to blame, nor is he 
You are old enough to know this 
You are too young to be in love 
You are twice as strong as I am 
You are very early this morning 
You ask me to do the impossible 
You can do anything you want to 
You can do whatever you want to 
You can eat as much as you want 
You can go home now if you like

You can reach me at this number

You know quite a lot about Sumo 
You know some French, don't you?
You know that I don't like eggs 
You know what I want, don't you?

You look gorgeous in that dress 
You made the same mistake again

You sound very sure of yourself 
You stole the money, didn't you?
You think I'm stupid, don't you?
You took some unnecessary risks 
You two seem to hate each other 
You were a bully in high school 
You were never much of a talker 
You were right about everything 
You were told this would happen 
You were very busy, weren't you?
You will be rewarded handsomely 
You will be welcome at any time 
You will never know where he is 
You will not get away with this 
You won't be needing that again

You're the tallest woman I know 
You're too young to get married 
You're used to that, aren't you?
You're very good at what you do 
You're very mature for your age 
You're wasting both of our time 
You're welcome to borrow my car 
You're welcome to give it a try 
You've got bags under your eyes 
You've got no right to say that 
You've lost weight, haven't you?
You've made your position clear 
You've missed an important clue 
Your CV has really impressed me 
Your English has improved a lot 
Your answer is far from perfect

Your bicycle is similar to mine 
Your clothes are out of fashion 
Your friend's in the other room 
Your idea is not entirely crazy 
Your kiss is sweeter than honey 
Your mother is going to kill me 
Your name sounds familiar to me 
Your order has been carried out 
Your parents know where you are 
Your problem is similar to mine

Dolphins and whales are not fish 
Don't always take sides with him 
Don't be afraid to make mistakes 
Don't be controlled by your fear 
Don't be deceived by appearances 
Don't be such a stick-in-the-mud

Don't bother to come to my house 
Don't bury your head in the sand 
Don't cry  Everything will be OK 
Don't eat my food while I'm gone 
Don't ever touch my things again 
Don't forget to flush the toilet 
Don't forget to mail this letter 
Don't forget to put out the fire 
Don't get involved with that guy 
Don't get that close to the fire 
Don't get your hopes up too much 
Don't handle these tools roughly 
Don't hesitate to ask for advice 
Don't interrupt our conversation 
Don't leave everything to chance 
Don't let him switch on the lamp 
Don't let him take his shoes off 
Don't let the cat out of the bag

Don't speak with your mouth full!
Don't speak with your mouth full

Don't waste your time doing that 
Don't waste your time on trifles 
Don't worry  I won't tell anyone 
Don't write me such long letters 
Don't you feel the house shaking?
Don't you think it's a good idea?
Don't you think that's a bit odd?
Don't you want me to do anything?
Don't you want me to go with Tom?
Don't you want me to go with you?
Dr  Jackson is our family doctor 
Drunk people are so entertaining 
Dublin is the capital of Ireland 
Dust had accumulated on the desk 
Each cat has its own personality 
Each country has its own customs 
Earthquakes frequently hit Japan 
England is going to win the race 
English is not my first language 
English is pretty hard, isn't it?
Ethics is a branch of philosophy 
Even Tom doesn't do that anymore 
Even a child can do such a thing 
Even a child can understand that 
Even children can read this book 
Even chocolate contains vitamins 
Even if he is busy, he will come 
Every child bowed to the teacher 
Every one of her songs was a hit 
Every one of his songs was a hit 
Every vote counts in an election 
Everybody had a problem with Tom 
Everybody knew her true feelings 
Everybody needs food, don't they?
Everybody was listening intently 
Everybody was wearing headphones 
Everyone is equal before the law 
Everyone knew that Tom was lying 
Everyone laughed at me yesterday 
Everyone seems to be busy but me 
Everyone was shocked by the news 
Everything that Tom said is true 
Except for Tom, everyone laughed 
Excuse me, I dropped a chopstick 
Explain to me why Tom isn't here 
Faded jeans are still in fashion 
Farther on, we came upon a house 
Fat people generally sweat a lot 
Father is busy putting up a wall 
Father wants to make me a doctor 
Few people know the true meaning 
First, you must protect yourself 
For example, do you like English?
For that reason, he lost his job 
Forgive me for wasting your time 
Forty-eight sailors are on board 
Four plus eighteen is twenty-two 
Friendship requires mutual trust 
From now on, let's keep in touch 
Germany produced many scientists 
Germany then had a powerful army 
Get an egg from the refrigerator 
Get in  I'll drive you somewhere 
Get into the car and wait for me 
Get up at seven tomorrow morning 
Give Tom whatever it is he wants 
Give a yell if you need anything 
Give help to anyone who needs it 
Give me a glass of water, please 
Give me three ice creams, please 
Go away before they see you here 
Go down this street three blocks 
God created man in his own image 
Good eating habits are essential 
Guess whose birthday it is today 
Handicapped parking is available 
Happy workers are better workers 
Have I told you this joke before?
Have a good look at this picture 
Have more confidence in yourself 
Have there been any calls for me?
Have they called the meeting yet?

I believe men are basically good 
I believe she is a charming girl 
I believe that the boy is honest 
I believe that the story is true 
I bet Tom doesn't even know Mary

I bought a camera for 30 dollars 
I bought the same shirt as yours 
I bought this book the other day 
I bought this watch at the store 
I brought you a little something 
I brush my teeth after breakfast 
I bumped into him at the station 
I came here to make you an offer 
I can assure you that's not true 
I can be just as stubborn as you 
I can do that with my bare hands 
I can drive a car, but Tom can't 
I can hardly believe you're here

I read this book again and again 
I realize it's probably too late 
I really can't make any promises 
I really don't want to live here 
I really don't want to miss that 
I received your letter yesterday 
I recognized him at first glance 
I refuse to discuss the question 
I regret having said that to him 
I regret that I can't come today 
I regret what happened yesterday 
I remember how angry you made me 
I saw a bum at the train station 
I saw many tourists on the beach 
I saw that movie a long time ago 
I saw that movie three years ago 
I saw the moon above the horizon 
I saw your brother the other day 
I see you've been shopping again 
I seem to have caught a bad cold

I think that they were all fired 
I think that we should try again 
I think that's a lot of malarkey 
I think that's for Tom to decide 
I think the train will come soon 
I think they did that on purpose 
I think this is the way to do it 
I think we can finish this later 
I think we can go on our way now 
I think we need more information 
I think you should eat something 
I think you should get more rest 
I think you're a really nice guy 
I think you're going to do great

I took Tom's umbrella by mistake 
I took the wheels off Tom's bike 
I touched the bottom of the pool 
I tried not to look disappointed 
I tried to swim across the river 
I trust that I can see you again 
I understand, but I cannot agree 
I used to be pretty good at this

I used to have that same problem 
I usually go to sleep very early

I warned you that Tom was coming 
I was bitten on the leg by a dog 
I was born on October 10th, 1972 
I was deceived by her appearance 
I was expecting you at 11:00 a m 
I was hoping that you might know 
I was in the hospital for a week 
I was just thinking of a new job 
I was just trying to be friendly 
I was just trying to impress Tom 
I was just trying to protect you 
I was late for work this morning 
I was laughed at in school today 
I was nearly run over by a truck 
I was surprised at the discovery 
I was surprised to get your call 
I was taking a bath when he came 
I was taught something different 
I was tired, so I didn't do that 
I was too tired to go on working 
I was unable to stand any longer 
I was vaccinated against the flu 
I was very glad to hear the news 
I was very moved by her kindness 
I was very surprised at the news 
I was with Tom the night he died

I wasn't happy with Tom's answer 
I watch a lot of gangster movies 
I went as far as the post office 
I went skiing at Zao last winter 
I went to Bali on summer holiday 
I went to sleep about 10 o'clock 
I went to the hospital yesterday 
I went to the scene of the crime 
I will ask him about it tomorrow 
I will do everything in my power 
I will go there even if it rains 
I will never violate a law again 
I will not go to school tomorrow 
I will try to eat it in one bite 
I wish I could be there with you 
I wish I could remember her name 
I wish I could remember his name 
I wish I could understand French 
I wish I had been there with you 
I wish he would write more often 
I wish that I could speak French

I would like to buy some aspirin 
I would like to come and see you 
I would like to have this camera 
I would like you to come with me 
I would never lend Tom any money 
I would rather not talk about it 
I wouldn't be so sure about that 
I wouldn't do that if I were you 
I wouldn't have said it that way 
I wouldn't mind a beer right now 
I wouldn't want anyone to see us 
I write letters almost every day 
I wrote a love letter last night

I'd rather take a taxi than walk 
I'd suggest the following change 
I'll arrive on October twentieth

I'll be back in a couple minutes 
I'll be lonely after you've gone 
I'll be there in fifteen minutes 
I'll be working all day tomorrow 
I'll call back in twenty minutes 
I'll call you if I hear anything 
I'll come back tomorrow if I can 
I'll deliver it as soon as I can 
I'll discuss the matter with Tom 
I'll eat my hat if Tom does that 
I'll go even if it rains heavily 
I'll have something for you soon 
I'll hire whoever Tom recommends 
I'll keep the menu as a souvenir 
I'll let you know in a day or so 
I'll let you know when it's done 
I'll make an exception this time 
I'll never be able to play again 
I'll never go out with Tom again 
I'll never leave you alone again 
I'll not make that mistake again 
I'll see you on Monday in Boston

I'll stay here till you get back 
I'll stay there till six o'clock 
I'll take back everything I said 
I'll teach you how to play chess 
I'll walk you back to your hotel 
I'm afraid I can't tell you that 
I'm afraid that you're in danger 
I'm afraid we can't go on Monday 
I'm always busy with my homework 
I'm beginning to see the picture 
I'm cold  May I close the window?
I'm convinced my son is innocent 
I'm downloading the pictures now 
I'm fed up with this wet weather 
I'm getting off at the next stop 
I'm getting used to eating alone 
I'm glad I didn't live back then 
I'm glad Tom is going to help us 
I'm glad to hear of your success 
I'm glad to see you in one piece 
I'm glad you asked me for advice 
I'm glad you guys are still here 
I'm going to Boston this weekend 
I'm going to chop this tree down 
I'm going to cook dinner tonight 
I'm going to do you a huge favor 
I'm going to have to dye my hair 
I'm going to send Tom some money 
I'm going to take a quick shower 
I'm going to tell you everything 
I'm half an inch taller than Tom 
I'm happy to be able to help you 
I'm in trouble  I need your help 
I'm just trying to be neighborly 
I'm just trying to buy some time 
I'm looking for a place to sleep 
I'm looking forward to Christmas 
I'm looking forward to the party 
I'm no slouch on the dance floor 
I'm not able to fix the computer 
I'm not afraid of snakes anymore 
I'm not allowed to drink alcohol 
I'm not doing this for the money 
I'm not going to do that anymore 
I'm not hiding anything from you 
I'm not in love with Tom anymore 
I'm not interested in modern art 
I'm not privy to their decisions 
I'm not ready for a relationship 
I'm not sure I can swim that far 
I'm not sure I feel the same way 
I'm not sure if Tom will do that 
I'm not taking Tom's word for it 
I'm not trying to impress anyone 
I'm not used to getting up early 
I'm old enough to be your father 
I'm old enough to live by myself 
I'm old enough to support myself 
I'm only interested in the truth 
I'm playing the devil's advocate 
I'm pleasantly surprised by that 
I'm practically already an adult 
I'm practically already grown up 
I'm practically an adult already 
I'm pretty sure Tom lied to Mary 
I'm really fed up with this heat 
I'm really looking forward to it 
I'm responsible for Tom's safety 
I'm satisfied with these results 
I'm sick and tired of hamburgers 
I'm sorry I stepped on your foot 
I'm sorry it worked out this way 
I'm sorry that you can't join us 
I'm sorry to trouble you so much

I'm sorry, but I have to go home 
I'm sorry, did you say something?
I'm sorry, today is fully booked 
I'm starting to lose my patience 
I'm sticking to my original plan 
I'm still suffering from jet lag 
I'm sure I have the right number 
I'm sure I saw her two years ago 
I'm sure I'll be able to find it 
I'm sure Tom intended to do that 
I'm sure Tom will come back soon 
I'm sure Tom would appreciate it 
I'm sure that wasn't intentional 
I'm sure there's another way out 
I'm sure we have a lot in common 
I'm sure you'll have enough time 
I'm taking Tom to Boston with me 
I'm the one who should apologize 
I'm the only one who can do that 
I'm the owner of this restaurant 
I'm the tallest one in the class 
I'm three inches taller than you 
I'm three years younger than you 
I'm tired of all this rigamarole 
I'm tired  I'm going to lie down 
I'm too tired to walk any longer 
I'm trying to memorize my speech 
I'm two years younger than he is 
I'm very pleased to have met you 
I'm very worried about my weight 
I'm waiting for a telephone call 
I'm waiting for her to come here 
I'm willing to accept your offer 
I've all but finished doing that 
I've already been here two hours 
I've already signed the contract 
I've already told Tom all I know 
I've been asked to do that again 
I've been busy since last Monday 
I've been given a death sentence 
I've been short of breath lately 
I've been silent for a long time 
I've been sober for eight months 
I've been swimming all afternoon 
I've been to Boston often enough 
I've been told that often enough 
I've been wanting to talk to you 
I've been worried sick about you 
I've changed my website's layout 
I've come to know Tom quite well 
I've done that a number of times 
I've done that quite a few times 
I've finished writing the letter 
I've given this a lot of thought 
I've given you my answer already 
I've got a bone to pick with Tom 
I've got a few questions for you 
I've got a lot of thinking to do 
I've got a surprise for you, Tom 
I've got as much money as he has 
I've got more money than Tom has 
I've got something you both need 
I've got to go to the men's room 
I've got to learn some new songs 
I've got to prepare for the test 
I've got to shave before leaving 
I've heard a lot about that, too 
I've heard good things about you 
I've heard quite a lot about you 
I've just arrived at the airport 
I've just arrived at the station 
I've just flown back from Boston 
I've lived here for thirty years 
I've never been on my own before 
I've never been this busy before 
I've never had to work very hard 
I've never heard of such a thing 
I've never seen Tom drunk before 
I've never seen a whale that big 
I've never seen anything like it 
I've packed my suitcases already 
I've saved you a seat next to me 
I've thanked Tom for the present 
I've told you not to call me Tom 
I've traveled all over Australia 
I've waited for more than a week 
I've worked with Tom a long time 
If I knew anything, I'd tell you 
If I were you, I would trust her 
If I were you, I'd paint it blue 
If Tom comes, please let me know 
If Tom goes to Boston, so will I 
If anybody calls, get his number 
If anybody can help us, it's Tom 
If anyone can fix this, it's Tom 
If anything happens, let me know 
If he saw you, he'd be surprised 
If it is worth doing, do it well 
If it isn't broken, don't fix it 
If it rains tomorrow, I won't go 
If it were up to me, I'd say yes 
If it were up to us, we'd say no 
If only I had known this earlier 
If only I'd been a little taller!
If possible, I'd like to see him 
If you are busy, I will help you 
If you are wrong, I am wrong too 
If you don't ask her out, I will 
If you don't believe me, ask Tom 
If you don't go, I won't, either 
If you need help, I can help you 
Illness kept me from going there 
In Australia, they speak English 
In Japan, school starts in April 
In autumn the leaves turn yellow 
In case of fire, push the button 
In school, Tom was often bullied 
In spite of the rain, I went out 
In the alphabet, B comes after A 
Instead of fretting, take action 
Is Tom studying French at school?
Is Tom the one who told you that?
Is eating healthy more expensive?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?
Is he coming home at six o'clock?
Is he taller than his brother is?
Is it OK if I change the channel?
Is it OK if I take a look around?
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
Is it possible that you're wrong?
Is it safe to swim in this river?
Is something the matter with Tom?
Is that the train I have to take?
Is that your car in the driveway?
Is the meeting today or tomorrow?
Is there a bank near the station?
Is there a flight in the morning?
Is there a gas station near here?
Is there a golf course near here?
Is there a supermarket near here?
Is there any danger of radiation?
Is there any food you don't like?
Is there any truth to that rumor?
Is there anything wrong with you?
Is there anywhere you want to go?
Is there something that you want?
Is this ticket good for this bus?
Is this your first investigation?
Is this your first time in Korea?
Is this your idea of a good time?
Isn't it true that you own a gun?
Isn't that how competition works?
Isn't that what Tom said to Mary?
It appears to me you're mistaken 
It doesn't bother me if you stay 
It doesn't have to end like that 
It doesn't look like you're sick 
It gets quite cold in the winter 
It hardly ever rains in the area 
It has been raining for two days 
It has been raining since Sunday 
It is Paris that I want to visit 
It is a little late for that now 
It is cold there, even in summer 
It is dangerous to drive so fast 
It is expensive to live in Japan 
It is impossible for me to do so 
It is interesting to play soccer 
It is no use asking for her help 
It is no use asking me for money 
It is obvious that that is a lie 
It is said that he was very rich 
It is still in the testing stage 
It is ten degrees below zero now 
It is two o'clock in the morning 
It is unbearably hot this summer 
It is worth visiting that museum 
It isn't death I fear, but dying 
It isn't worth worrying about it 
It just was not my day yesterday 
It looked like Tom was disgusted 
It looks like Tom is unconvinced 
It looks like it's going to rain 
It looks like it's going to snow 
It looks like we have everything 
It looks like you're on your own 
It must have been a shock to you 
It only took about three minutes 
It probably wouldn't have helped 
It rained heavily in the morning 
It requires skill and dedication 
It seems obvious that he is sick 
It seems that the news was false 
It seems that we've lost our way 
It seems to me that he is honest 
It seems to me that you're wrong 
It seems we are in the same boat 
It snowed a good deal last night 
It sounds like someone is crying 
It sounds like you're having fun 
It took little more than an hour 
It turned out to be a lovely day 
It was a one hundred dollar bill 
It was a simple misunderstanding 
It was cloudy all day long today 
It was dark and cold in the room 
It was less than fifteen dollars 
It was nothing but a coincidence 
It was obvious that he was lying 
It was that dog that bit my hand 
It was the best night of my life 
It was the calm before the storm 
It was very cold, but I went out 
It was very dark inside the mine 
It was very dark inside the room 
It was you that made the mistake!
It will stop raining before long 
It won't happen again, I promise 
It would be smart not to do that 
It would break if you dropped it 
It would only be a waste of time 
It would probably be a good idea 
It wouldn't have mattered anyway 
It'll be easy for you to do that 
It'll cost at least five dollars 
It's a beautiful night, isn't it?
It's a good thing Tom isn't here 
It's a great way to make friends 
It's a lot easier than I thought 
It's a lot of fun going on trips 
It's a lot of fun to be with you 
It's a pleasure to meet you, Tom 
It's about time I was going home 
It's about time for you to leave 
It's already time to go to sleep 
It's an unforgettable impression 
It's as much an art as a science 
It's been ages since we last met 
It's dangerous to go there alone 
It's dangerous to play with fire 
It's definitely starting to rain 
It's difficult to peel chestnuts 
It's doubtful if Tom can do that 
It's easy to make and it's cheap 
It's essential that we find them 
It's evident that you told a lie 
It's going to be another hot day 
It's going to take about an hour 
It's illegal to waste water here 
It's impolite to stare at people 
It's just a friendly competition 
It's just the tip of the iceberg 
It's my responsibility, isn't it?
It's nice to see a familiar face 
It's not clear when he came here 
It's not death I fear, but dying 
It's not easy to thread a needle 
It's not quite as simple as that 
It's not something anyone can do 
It's obvious that you told a lie 
It's pitch black in the basement 
It's pitch black inside the cave 
It's quite unlikely Tom will win 
It's really not worth the effort 
It's really very easy to do that 
It's time for me to be on my way 
It's time for your afternoon nap 
It's too dark to play tennis now 
It's very kind of you to help me 
It's very nice of you to help me 
It's your duty to finish the job 
Just give us a couple of minutes 
Just keep your mind on your work 
Just put those packages anywhere 
Karate is a Japanese martial art 
Keep quiet  The baby is sleeping 
Kenya became independent in 1963 
Last night, I heard dogs howling 
Let Tom know we've got a problem 
Let me ask you a simple question 
Let me finish eating my sandwich 
Let me give you a word of advice 
Let me have another look at that 
Let me know if you need anything 
Let me know when you'll be ready 
Let me know when you've finished 
Let me take a look at your tires 
Let us know whether you can come 
Let us never speak of this again 
Let's discuss that problem later 
Let's forget the whole thing, OK?
Let's get this meeting over with 
Let's get this over with quickly 
Let's go before things get worse 
Let's go to the theater together 
Let's meet in front of the hotel 
Let's not let things get us down 
Let's not talk about it any more 
Let's play baseball after school 
Let's pretend this didn't happen 
Let's see what Tom can do for us 
Let's shake hands and be friends 
Let's take an X-ray just in case 
Let's take it one step at a time 
Let's talk about it after school 
Let's talk about why you're here 
Let's wait and see what Tom says 
Let's wait for another 5 minutes 
Life is full of confusing things 
Life is like a box of chocolates 
Life was a lot simpler back then

Liquor is not sold at this store

May I ask what you're working on?
May I have a look at your ticket?
May I have another piece of cake?
May I make a suggestion about it?
May I see your birth certificate?
May I see your invitation please?

Maybe Tom is too busy to help us 
Maybe you don't want to remember

Take your time  There's no hurry 
Talking during a concert is rude 
Taxi fares will go up next month 
Tell Tom I'd like to talk to him 
Tell Tom he has to do that today 
Tell Tom that I'll call him back 
Tell her that I am taking a bath 
Tell me how to solve the problem 
Tell me something about yourself 
Tell me why you want to go there 
Telling lies is a very bad habit 
Ten years is a long time to wait 
Thank you for building this wall 
Thank you for calling me on time 
Thank you for fixing my car, Tom 
Thank you for the Christmas gift 
Thank you for the wonderful gift 
Thank you for the wonderful meal

That box is bigger than this one 
That child has a very large head 
That company produces microchips 
That didn't stop Tom from trying 
That doesn't mean anything to me 
That hotel is very near the lake 
That hotel serves very good food 
That is the house where he lives 
That isn't actually what I meant 
That kind of story appeals to me 
That makes you happy, doesn't it?
That man didn't give me his name 
That medicine worked well for me 
That meeting was a waste of time 
That name doesn't ring any bells 
That nickname fits him perfectly 
That old man caught a large fish 
That patient may die at any time 
That place is said to be haunted 
That plane will take off at five 
That play was an immense success 
That red dress looks good on her 
That shouldn't have been allowed 
That small star is the brightest 
That sounds credible, doesn't it?
That was a new experience for me 
That was my first visit to Japan 
That was obviously a stupid idea 
That was only a figure of speech 
That was the best day of my life 
That was very considerate of Tom 
That won't be any problem at all 
That wouldn't have happened here 
That'll be seven dollars, please 
That'll cause a lot of criticism 
That's a beautiful piece of meat 
That's a hard question to answer 
That's a secret I can't tell you 
That's a very difficult question 
That's a very interesting theory 
That's an interesting suggestion 
That's an overly optimistic view 
That's certainly one possibility 
That's exactly what Tom is doing 
That's exactly what you need now 
That's going to happen very soon 
That's just the way she likes it 
That's not a proper thing to say 
That's not exactly what happened 
That's not how you spell my name 
That's only a temporary solution 
That's really not the same thing 
That's surely a misunderstanding 
That's the book I told you about 
That's the most important reason 
That's the village I was born in 
That's what I want to understand 
That's what I'm asking you to do 
That's what Tom keeps telling me 
That's what you don't understand 
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
That's when I knew Tom was lying 
That's why I came to talk to you 
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary 
That's why you're here, isn't it?

The doctor prescribed it for her 
The doctor rushed to his patient

There is one thing I want to ask

We all learned the poem by heart 
We almost got caught a few times 
We always have to obey the rules 
We are going to meet him tonight 
We associate Egypt with the Nile

Wow! You've lost a lot of weight 
Yesterday, I didn't say anything 
Yesterday, I put honey in my tea 
You always take the lion's share!
You always were good at your job 
You and Tom have a lot in common 
You are entitled to your opinion 
You are exactly like your father 
You are exactly like your mother 
You aren't allowed to park there 
You aren't supposed to swim here 
You can always sleep on my couch 
You can ask me anything you like 
You can call me anytime you like 
You can have as many as you want 
You can make 4, 6 or 12 payments 
You can play outside if you want 
You can reach the village by bus 
You can stay as long as you like 
You can't believe a word he says 
You can't buy it under 1,000 yen

You don't necessarily have to go 
You don't need to worry about it 
You don't really mean it, do you?
You don't seem to be very hungry 
You don't want to seem desperate 
You forgot to turn off the light 
You had better not go after dark 
You had better not see her today 
You handled that very skillfully 
You have good reason to be angry 
You have only three minutes left 
You have only to watch what I do 
You have to answer this question 
You have to believe in something 
You have to make Tom believe you 
You have to see it to believe it 
You have to tighten those screws 
You have until morning to decide 
You haven't answered my question 
You haven't finished your coffee 
You hit the center of the target 
You just don't know how it feels 
You know I can't wait any longer 
You know Tom has a thing for you

You know why I'm here, don't you?
You liked that movie, didn't you?
You look ravishing in that dress 
You look terrible  What happened?
You look very happy this morning 
You make an interesting argument 
You may choose any book you like 
You may do that if you'd like to 
You may take either of the books 
You may talk as much as you like 
You might at least say thank you 
You must always do what is right

You must get up a little earlier 
You must make your own decisions 
You must make your parents happy 
You must not go out after dinner

You need to finish your homework 
You need to reboot your computer 
You only imagine you've heard it 
You ought not to stay up so late 
You probably don't recognize her 
You really don't like me, do you?
You really don't need to do that 
You really need to get a haircut 
You really should be helping Tom 
You said that thirty minutes ago

You talk as if you were the boss 
You three seem to want something 
You two look like you're in love 
You two would make a nice couple 
You understand French, don't you?
You understand Korean, don't you?
You were always a little strange 
You were always such a happy boy 
You were having fun, weren't you?
You were never very good at math 
You were pretending, weren't you?
You will be shocked to hear this 
You will know the truth some day 
You will need time to understand 
You won't believe who I just saw 
You won't need an umbrella today 
You work harder than anyone here 
You wouldn't have recognized Tom 
You wouldn't have won without me 
You'd better consult your doctor 
You'll be better off without Tom 
You'll be hearing from my lawyer 
You'll be missed by your friends 
You'll find this map very useful 
You'll have to ask somebody else 
You'll make Tom a very happy man 
You'll never guess what happened 
You're a little too young for me 
You're a philosopher, aren't you?
You're a very interesting person 
You're an overly optimistic girl 
You're asking the wrong question 
You're barking up the wrong tree 
You're going to be a good father 
You're going to be so happy here 
You're going to have so much fun 
You're going to love living here 
You're going to make a great dad 
You're going to want to see this 
You're going with me, aren't you?
You're in better shape than I am 
You're lucky you didn't get shot 
You're making a terrible mistake 
You're my brother and I love you 
You're needed here at the office 
You're no longer part of my life 
You're not a very good liar, Tom 
You're not allowed to park there 
You're not ambitious enough, Tom 
You're not answering my question 
You're not as stupid as you look 
You're not authorized to be here 
You're not even paying attention 
You're not feeling well, are you?
You're not going to believe this 
You're not good at this, are you?
You're not my girlfriend anymore 
You're not paid to ask questions 
You're old enough to know better 
You're out of touch with reality 
You're shallow and materialistic 
You're the best dad in the world 
You're the laziest person I know 
You're three years older than me 
You're too young to travel alone 
You're welcome here anytime, Tom 
You've got the right to be happy 
You've got thirteen minutes left 
You've probably seen a lot worse 
Your French is really quite good 
Your approval is important to me 
Your article was published today 
Your composition is the best yet 
Your handwriting is hard to read 
Your husband is a very lucky man 
Your idea sounds like a good one 
Your mother has always loved you 
Your plan seems better than mine 
Your secret will be safe with me 
Your shoes are on the wrong feet 
Your smile always makes me happy 
Your watch is three minutes slow 
1980 was the year that I was born 
Are you students?  Yes, we are  
Are you tired?  No, not at all  
Does Tom love you?  I think so  
Give me another bottle, he said 
How are you?  I can't complain  
I am happy, she said to herself 
I thought you liked him   I do  
Where's Tom?  How would I know? 
A DNA test proved he was innocent 
A DNA test showed he was innocent 
A ball flew in through the window 
A ball is floating down the river 
A balloon was floating in the air 
A bear will not touch a dead body 
A bowl of rice is about 180 grams 
A convict has escaped from prison 
A crazy thing just happened to me 
A few days' rest will do you good

After the storm, the sea was calm 
Air is a mixture of several gases 
All I ate yesterday was one apple 
All I found is a pair of scissors 
All at once, I heard a shrill cry 
All in all, this was a nice party 
All of a sudden, it began raining 
All of my children live in Boston 
All the apple trees were cut down 
All the boys in class worked hard 
All the girls are crazy about Tom 
All we know is that Tom is guilty 
All we need is a little more time 
All you had to do was talk to Tom 
All you need is a little patience 
Almost all boys can play baseball

As far as I know, he's a nice guy 
As long as you're here, I'll stay 
As soon as he saw me, he ran away 
As was expected, Tom won the race 
As was expected, he won the prize 
Ask Tom what his sister's name is 
At first, they didn't believe him

Australia is abundant in minerals

Give me the equivalent in dollars

Her answer couldn't be understood 
Her anxiety almost drove her wild

Her death was a great shock to me 
Her mother always accompanies her 
Her new hairstyle covers her ears 
Here is a photograph of my family 
Here's some medicine for diarrhea 
Here's someone I want you to meet 
Hey, Tom, can I ask you something?
His behavior is sometimes strange 
His behavior is worthy of respect 
His brave deed earned him respect 
His brother goes to school by bus 
His condition got worse every day 
His family didn't have much money 
His help came in the nick of time 
His house was struck by lightning 
His letter doesn't make any sense 
His office is on the eighth floor 
His policies were too progressive 
His position enabled him to do so 
His sleeve touched the greasy pan 
His son had been killed in a duel 
His speech impressed us very much 
His theory deserves consideration 
His voice was heard above the din 
His wealth has not made him happy 
His work finished, he went to bed 
How about dining out for a change?
How about something cold to drink?
How are you and Tom getting along?
How are you going to convince Tom?

Hurry up! The concert is starting 
Hurry up, or we'll miss the train 
I accidentally deleted everything 
I admit that I was a little drunk 
I almost didn't do that yesterday 
I almost forgot to do my homework 
I almost never get what I ask for 
I always knew this day would come 
I am ashamed of my son's laziness 
I am complaining to the principal 
I am determined to be a scientist 
I am fed up with his vulgar jokes 
I am fed up with this wet weather 
I am glad that you have succeeded 
I am happy that you are my friend 
I am looking forward to Christmas 
I am no more excited than you are 
I am not about to pay ten dollars 
I am not going anywhere on Sunday 
I am not what I was ten years ago 
I am pleased to help you if I can 
I am putting on weight these days 
I am ready to do anything for you 
I am responsible for this failure 
I am studying Chinese and Spanish 
I am sure I saw her two years ago 
I am sure of his passing the exam 
I am sure we have a lot in common 
I am who I am thanks to my mother 
I applied for a summer internship 
I arrived here about five o'clock 
I asked Tom how his job was going 
I asked Tom if he wanted to drive 
I asked Tom what he wanted to eat 
I asked Tom where he wanted to go 
I asked him to lend me some money 
I asked myself that same question 
I asked the doctor some questions 
I asked you not to play with that 
I assume you still live in Boston 
I assume you're talking about Tom 
I assure you that isn't necessary 
I avoid going there late at night 
I believe I can help you find Tom 
I believe it is a genuine Picasso 
I believe they're a perfect match 
I bought a car in Derry yesterday 
I bought a smartphone for my wife 
I bought it at a department store 
I bought the book for ten dollars 
I broke his heart, but I love him 
I broke my arm when I was a child 
I burned my fingers on a hot iron 
I called him a coward to his face 
I came here to give you something 
I came here to tell you something 
I came here to warn you about Tom 
I can barely sleep at all anymore 
I can both speak and write French 
I can get you everything you need 
I can meet you at the bus station 
I can see Tom wasn't exaggerating 
I can see the top of the mountain 
I can't bear the noise any longer 
I can't believe I listened to you 
I can't believe Tom remembered me 
I can't believe Tom still uses it 
I can't buy a book this expensive 
I can't decide where to eat lunch 
I can't decide which house to buy 
I can't drive Tom to school today 
I can't even remember my own name 
I can't find what I'm looking for 
I can't give you the answer today 
I can't hear a word Tom is saying 
I can't imagine a day without you 
I can't let you go in there alone 
I can't lift this  It's too heavy 
I can't make a decision on my own 
I can't make that kind of promise 
I can't predict what might happen 
I can't promise Tom won't be back 
I can't put up with it any longer 
I can't put up with these insults 
I can't raise our child by myself 
I can't remember how long it took 
I can't remember who I gave it to 
I can't say anything at this time 
I can't see who Tom is talking to 
I can't seem to do anything right 
I can't sleep with all this noise 
I can't talk about that right now 
I can't talk about this right now 
I can't talk you out of it, can I?
I can't tell you what Tom told me 
I can't think of life without you 
I cannot trust a person like that 
I captured butterflies with a net 
I constantly quarrel with my wife 
I convinced him that he was wrong 
I could get you arrested for that 
I could hardly close the suitcase 
I could hardly keep from laughing 
I could have sworn I saw somebody 
I could never go back there again 
I could recite the story by heart 
I could use a little help in here 
I could've met you at the airport 
I couldn't agree with his opinion 
I couldn't find a taxi last night 
I couldn't make myself understood 
I couldn't recognize her at first 
I cry every time I hear this song 
I cut myself shaving this morning 
I decided to study all night long 
I definitely want to do that soon 
I did nothing during the holidays 
I did nothing out of the ordinary 
I did that while Tom was sleeping 
I didn't ask you for your opinion 
I didn't expect you to come today 
I didn't feel like talking to Tom 
I didn't find everything I needed 
I didn't finish reading that book 
I didn't go to school last Monday 
I didn't intend to argue with Tom 
I didn't know Tom lived in Boston 
I didn't know Tom was Mary's boss 
I didn't know Tom was coming back 
I didn't know exactly what to say 
I didn't know he had a weak heart 
I didn't know that dogs swim well 
I didn't know tofu was this tasty 
I didn't know you cared that much 
I didn't know you had a boyfriend 
I didn't know you played the oboe 
I didn't like what he said at all 
I didn't manage to see who it was 
I didn't mean to step on any toes 
I didn't need any help doing that 
I didn't need to pay for the food 
I didn't read any books yesterday 
I didn't realize how hungry I was 
I didn't realize what I was doing 
I didn't realize what time it was 
I didn't see Tom at all yesterday 
I didn't see him again after that 
I didn't send any pictures to Tom 
I didn't tell Tom that I knew you 
I didn't think Tom was suspicious 
I didn't think this was your seat 
I didn't understand what you said 
I didn't understand your question 
I dipped my finger into the honey 
I disagree with you on the matter 
I do not doubt that he is sincere 
I don't believe Tom is the killer 
I don't believe anything Tom says 
I don't believe such things exist 
I don't care for the way he talks 
I don't care what you think of me 
I don't even know Tom's last name 
I don't even know where Tom lives 
I don't feel like speaking German 
I don't feel like watching TV now 
I don't get enough sleep at night 
I don't go to school on Saturdays

I don't have a lot of money on me 
I don't have any Canadian friends 
I don't have any feelings for Tom 
I don't have anybody to play with 
I don't have anything to give you 
I don't have the money to do that 
I don't have time to take a break 
I don't have to worry about money 
I don't know any more than you do 
I don't know anybody by that name 
I don't know anybody in this town 
I don't know anyone who likes Tom 
I don't know anything about Japan 
I don't know her telephone number 
I don't know how deep the lake is

I don't know what that means, Tom 
I don't know what this is made of 
I don't know what this word means 
I don't know what to do about Tom 
I don't know what to do right now 
I don't know what to do with this 
I don't know what to make of this 
I don't know what your problem is 
I don't know what's going on here 
I don't know when he'll come back 
I don't know when he'll come here 
I don't know when she got married 
I don't know where Tom is staying 
I don't know where that came from

I don't know which button to push 
I don't know who to trust anymore 
I don't know who you want to meet 
I don't know why Tom got so angry

I don't like Tom and I never will 
I don't like any of these records 
I don't like people looking at me 
I don't like people staring at me 
I don't like talking about myself 
I don't like to talk about myself 
I don't like your going out alone 
I don't need to go anywhere today 
I don't own any expensive jewelry

I don't really know Tom very well 
I don't remember agreeing to that 
I don't remember her name anymore 
I don't remember seeing it before 
I don't remember who gave me this 
I don't see that there's a choice 
I don't study as much as Tom does 
I don't swim as much as I used to 
I don't teach French here anymore 
I don't think I can do this alone 
I don't think I'll pass this exam 
I don't think he killed those men 
I don't think he knows I love you 
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow 
I don't think it's anyone's fault 
I don't think that Tom was afraid 
I don't think that Tom was hiding 
I don't think we have enough time 
I don't think we'll see Tom again 
I don't think we've got much time 
I don't think you should eat that 
I don't think you're being honest 
I don't understand how this works 
I don't understand your reasoning

I don't want to do anything risky 
I don't want to give up right now 
I don't want to go shopping today 
I don't want to go to the dentist

I don't want to live here anymore 
I don't want to see anybody today 
I don't want to talk about it now 
I don't want to talk about school 
I don't want to tell Tom anything 
I don't want to think about death 
I don't want to try anything else 
I don't want to work here anymore 
I doubt Tom would be that foolish 
I doubt that's just a coincidence 
I dreamed about you the other day 
I drove to town and went shopping 
I erased my hard disk by accident 
I expect Tom will know what to do 
I expect you to tell me the truth 
I explained the procedures to him 
I feel comfortable in her company 
I feel comfortable in his company 
I feel so happy when I'm with you 
I fell asleep with my contacts in 
I felt an impulse to cry out loud 
I felt better after I took a rest 
I felt my heart beating violently 
I felt that my honor was at stake 
I finally found out what happened 
I finally was able to contact Tom 
I forgot to pay the electric bill 
I forgot to tell you where I live 
I found Tom's secret hiding place 
I found a good Mexican restaurant 
I found it hard to close the door 
I found out what's wrong with Tom

I guess Tom is looking after Mary 
I guess it depends on the weather

I just want to live a normal life 
I just wanted to get it over with 
I killed two birds with one stone 
I knew Tom wasn't going to change 
I knew you were going to ask that 
I knew you were hiding in the car 
I know I shouldn't have done that 
I know Tom is thinking about that

I made up my mind to study harder 
I meet her at school now and then 
I met her on a certain winter day 
I met him on the street by chance 
I met him then for the first time 
I might have left it on the table 
I moved to Boston three weeks ago 
I moved to Boston three years ago 
I moved to a new office this week 
I must remind you of your promise 
I must work hard to pass the test 
I must've parked my car elsewhere 
I nearly got hit by a truck today 
I need some help with my homework 
I need to be alone so I can think 
I need to find a new hiding place 
I need to get to this meeting now 
I need to put the children to bed 
I need to stop thinking about Tom 
I need to talk with you about Tom 
I need you to do something for me

I never should've listened to you 
I never thought I'd see him there

I ran in order to make it on time 
I reached the village before dark 
I really appreciate all your help 
I really appreciate your kindness 
I really do miss my parents a lot 
I really don't know Tom that well 
I really hope that doesn't happen 
I really liked watching you dance 
I really should be getting to bed 
I received your message yesterday 
I refuse to be ignored any longer 
I regard crab as a great delicacy 
I regret having done such a thing 
I remember Tom asking for my help 
I remember everything you tell me 
I remember hearing the story once 
I remember that I closed the door 
I said that quite a long time ago 
I sat down and opened my notebook 
I saw Tom and Mary leave together 
I saw Tom and his dog in the park 
I saw Tom getting into Mary's car 
I saw Tom running down the street 
I saw a cat running after the dog 
I saw a dog swim across the river 
I saw a horse galloping toward me 
I saw a man knocked down by a car 
I saw a stranger enter that house 
I saw a white bird on my way home 
I saw her somewhere two years ago 
I saw my reflection in the window 
I saw something white in the park 
I saw them over there a while ago 
I say this from my own experience 
I screamed at the top of my lungs 
I see someone waving a white flag 
I sharpened a pencil with a knife 
I should have done this weeks ago 
I should have done this years ago 
I should've apologized right away 
I should've followed Tom's advice 
I should've given you this sooner 
I should've invited Tom to dinner 
I should've known you'd come back 
I should've listened to my father 
I should've listened to my mother 
I should've put on some sunscreen 
I shouldn't have reacted that way 
I shoved my hands into my pockets 
I showed Tom how to tie a bowline 
I sit next to Tom in French class 
I smell something burning, Mother 
I sold the picture for 20,000 yen 
I spend money as soon as I get it 
I spent the whole day in the park 
I spent twelve hours on the train 
I spoke to Tom just the other day 
I spoke with him about the matter 
I spread the big map on the table 
I stayed in Boston for three days 
I still can't believe it happened 
I still don't know how to do this 
I still don't trust Tom very much 
I still have some pain in my knee 
I still haven't apologized to Tom 
I still wonder why Tom didn't win 
I study English an hour every day 
I study about two hours every day 
I think I can handle it from here 
I think I remember how to do that 
I think I'll walk to school today 
I think Tom did the best he could 
I think Tom didn't understand you 
I think Tom is afraid of your dog 
I think Tom is the one who'll win 
I think Tom knows what he's doing 
I think Tom looks a lot like John 
I think Tom was born in Australia 
I think Tom went to Boston by car 
I think Tom would have liked that 
I think he takes after his father 
I think he's Mary's older brother 
I think it was a misunderstanding 
I think it'll be raining tomorrow 
I think it'll rain this afternoon 
I think it's better not to try it 
I think it's time for us to leave 
I think my French isn't very good 
I think my German isn't very good 
I think that there is a man there 
I think that we're going to be OK 
I think there's someone out there 
I think we both know why I'm here 
I think we should call the police 
I think we should just be friends 
I think we should leave Tom alone 
I think we should lower the price 
I think we'll make it if we hurry 
I think you and he wanna be alone 
I think you know why I called you 
I think you'd better go on a diet 
I think you're on the right track 
I think you're sitting in my seat 
I think you're too drunk to drive 
I think you've been here too long 
I think you've made a big mistake 
I thought I could be of some help 
I thought I told you to go to bed 
I thought I'd never see you again 
I thought Tom had a place to live 
I thought Tom had stopped smoking 
I thought Tom wanted to marry you 
I thought Tom was meeting us here 
I thought Tom would agree with me 
I thought about you the other day 
I thought it might be complicated 
I thought it was common knowledge 
I thought it would be a good idea 
I thought it would make him laugh 
I thought it would make you laugh 
I thought that would interest you 
I thought that's why Tom was here 
I thought the food was too greasy 
I thought we had an understanding 
I thought you said Tom was a jerk 
I thought you said Tom was stupid 
I thought you said you were alone 
I thought you two knew each other 
I thought you wanted to marry Tom 
I thought you were already in bed 
I thought you were my best friend 
I thought you were off duty today 
I thought you would recognize Tom 
I threw the paper into the flames 
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here 
I told Tom how proud I was of him 
I told Tom that I didn't like him 
I told you I don't want your help 
I told you I'd think of something 
I told you not to call me at work 
I told you we had a lot in common 
I took a sleeping pill last night 
I took the liberty of calling her 
I tried to hide my disappointment 
I tried writing with my left hand 
I try to visit Tom whenever I can 
I used to be Tom's French teacher 
I used to feed my dog twice a day 
I used to go to church on Sundays 
I usually get home by six o'clock 
I usually get up at eight o'clock 
I usually go to school by bicycle 
I usually have breakfast at seven 
I visited Romania a few years ago 
I visited my friend Tom yesterday 
I walked the length of the street 
I want a massage  I need to relax 
I want a tie to go with this suit 
I want to avoid unnecessary risks 
I want to be able to speak French 
I want to be treated with respect 
I want to become a French teacher 
I want to become a better teacher 
I want to buy a pair of ski boots 
I want to give my old desk to Tom 
I want to go play with my friends

I want to know why Tom isn't here 
I want to know why you lied to me 
I want to learn Chinese next year 
I want to set the record straight 
I want to spend my life with Mary 
I want to tell you one thing more 
I want to travel around the world 
I want you to go to Osaka at once 
I want you to help me clean it up 
I want you to listen to this song 
I want you to look out the window 
I want you to meet my friend, Tom 
I want you to return to your seat 
I want you to wear your new dress 
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom 
I wanted to make Tom feel at home 
I wanted to punch him in the face 
I wanted to see what would happen 
I was a teacher for fifteen years 
I was able to answer the question 
I was able to win the first prize 
I was about to say the same thing 
I was affected by the summer heat 
I was already married at your age 
I was beginning to have my doubts 
I was born the year the war ended 
I was chained to the desk all day 
I was disappointed at the results 
I was extremely naive at the time 
I was happy that she took my side 
I was hoping you'd find something 
I was impressed with Tom's French 
I was in Australia all last month 
I was in Boston almost all summer 
I was in danger of losing my life 
I was just in time for the flight 
I was just looking out the window 
I was late because of the traffic 
I was looking for the right words 
I was moved to tears by the story 
I was present at school yesterday 
I was really young when I met you 
I was stupid enough to believe it 
I was surprised, to say the least 
I was taken up to the third floor 
I was talking about it last night 
I was ten minutes late for school 
I was the first to begin speaking 
I was tired, but I couldn't sleep 
I was too ashamed to say anything 
I was very happy to hear the news 
I was very impressed by his story 
I was waiting for you to say that 
I watch television in the evening 
I watched a great movie yesterday 
I went for a drive in the country 
I went for a walk to get some air 
I went to sleep during the lesson 
I went up to my bedroom on tiptoe 
I will abolish capital punishment 
I will be back in two week's time 
I will be free tomorrow afternoon 
I will finish my homework by nine 
I will follow you wherever you go 
I will give her the book tomorrow 
I will give him the book tomorrow 
I will give you anything you want 
I will give you whatever you want 
I will go provided that she comes 
I will have him repair this watch 
I will leave it to your judgement 
I will live in Sasayama next year 
I will not live in Kobe next year 
I will play tennis this afternoon 
I will tell the woman what I know 
I will tell you the rest tomorrow 
I wish I could have gone with her 
I wish I could run as fast as Tom 
I wish I were as smart as you are 
I wish Tom was here with me today 
I wish Tom was here with us today 
I wish Tom would smile more often 
I wish it would happen more often 
I wish my father had lived longer 
I wish that you were here with me 
I wish we could do this every day 
I wish you had let Tom go with us 
I wish you weren't always so busy 
I wish you would stop doubting me 
I wish you wouldn't smoke so much 
I won't be leaving until tomorrow 
I won't bore you with the details 
I won't let anyone push me around 
I won't lower myself to his level 
I won't take up much of your time 
I wonder if I hurt Tom's feelings 
I wonder if I'll ever get married 
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary 
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow 
I wonder if the weather will hold 
I wonder what they have in common 
I wonder where Tom parked the car 
I wonder where Tom studied French 
I wonder whether Tom will help us 
I wonder whose scissors these are 
I wonder whose these scissors are 
I wonder why Tom is staring at me 
I would be very sad if I lost you 
I would like some hot tea, please 
I would like to ask two questions 
I would like to hear your opinion 
I would like to improve my French 
I would like to make a phone call 
I would like to move to Australia 
I would like to try this dress on 
I would love a cold glass of beer 
I would never want this to change 
I would prefer an honorable death 
I would rather die than marry him 
I would rather die than surrender 
I wouldn't go there if I were you 
I wouldn't sell that at any price 
I wouldn't want to live in Boston 
I write to my mother once a month 
I wrote more today than yesterday 
I'd have come if you'd invited me 
I'd like bread and butter, please 
I'd like to ask Tom what he means 
I'd like to cancel my reservation 
I'd like to change my reservation 
I'd like to discuss this with Tom 
I'd like to go somewhere else now 
I'd like to have a glass of water 
I'd like to have cake for dessert 
I'd like to have this fabric dyed 
I'd like to know what I did wrong 
I'd like to look at the wine list 
I'd like to play a game of squash 
I'd like to reserve a single room 
I'd like to sail around the world 
I'd like to see someone do better 
I'd like to sleep a little longer 
I'd like to speak French fluently 
I'd like to speak to Tom if I may 
I'd like to volunteer my services 
I'd like to work at the cafeteria 
I'd like you to look after my dog 
I'd like you to look at something 
I'd like you to wait in the lobby 
I'd love to know what's happening 
I'd never have done that that way 
I'd never marry someone like that 
I'd never played that game before 
I'd rather go today than tomorrow 
I'd rather live in a wooden house 
I'd rather not ask Tom to do that 
I'd rather ride my bike than walk 
I'll accompany you to the station 
I'll be able to do that on my own 
I'll be able to see you next year 
I'll be back in a couple of hours 
I'll be free three hours from now 
I'll be here from 2:30 until 6:30 
I'll be in Australia next weekend 
I'll be there in about 30 minutes 
I'll be with you in a few minutes 
I'll bet Tom will know what to do 
I'll call you in a couple of days 
I'll call you up tomorrow morning 
I'll certainly be sad if Tom dies 
I'll do anything you ask me to do 
I'll do that first thing tomorrow 
I'll follow Tom's recommendations 
I'll give you everything you need 
I'll go and get the book tomorrow 
I'll have to give it some thought 
I'll introduce you to a nice girl 
I'll invite whoever wants to come 
I'll let you know when it's ready 
I'll miss you very much if you go 
I'll never forget this experience 
I'll probably be doing that again 
I'll probably never do that again 
I'll see you again this afternoon 
I'll send the book to you by mail 
I'll take that into consideration 
I'll talk to Tom later about this 
I'll teach you how to drive a car 
I'll turn around while you change 
I'll wait here till he comes back 
I'm a big fan of American cooking 
I'm a member of the swimming club 
I'm accustomed to sitting up late 
I'm afraid I can't come on Monday 
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape 
I'm afraid that won't be possible 
I'm afraid that's not good enough 
I'm afraid we don't have any left 
I'm aware you've already finished 
I'm beginning to get used to this 
I'm beginning to lose my patience 
I'm better at French than English 
I'm busy looking for an apartment 
I'm calling from Tom's cell phone 
I'm excited about going to Boston 
I'm glad to see that you're happy 
I'm glad you talked me into going 
I'm going back home for Christmas 
I'm going back to Boston tomorrow 
I'm going to Tom's house to study 
I'm going to allow Tom to do that 
I'm going to buy a box of matches 
I'm going to go find the restroom 
I'm going to go for a little walk 
I'm going to join a demonstration 
I'm going to need some volunteers 
I'm going to play tennis tomorrow 
I'm going to report you to police 
I'm going to rest before I go out 
I'm going to stay at home tonight 
I'm going to take the 10:30 train 
I'm going to the dentist tomorrow 
I'm going to the library to study 
I'm going to the village tomorrow 
I'm grateful to you for your help 
I'm here because I need your help 
I'm here to fix the broken window 
I'm here to help in any way I can 
I'm just trying to understand you 
I'm learning to play the clarinet 
I'm looking for a bag for my wife 
I'm looking for one of my sisters 
I'm looking forward to seeing Tom 
I'm looking forward to seeing him 
I'm not as famous as I used to be 
I'm not as old as Tom thinks I am 
I'm not as rich as I'd like to be 
I'm not authorized to do anything 
I'm not doing this with you again 
I'm not going to Boston this year 
I'm not going to do that with Tom 
I'm not going to go unless you go 
I'm not going to put up with this 
I'm not going to take that chance 
I'm not happy with this situation 
I'm not impressed with Tom's work 
I'm not rich, but not poor either 
I'm not rich, nor do I wish to be 
I'm not sure I want to touch that 
I'm not sure if I'll go to Boston 
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive 
I'm not sure where to park my car 
I'm not sure who Tom's married to 
I'm not sure who Tom's teacher is 
I'm not taking the blame for that 
I'm not used to going to bed late 
I'm not used to this kind of cold 
I'm not used to working this hard 
I'm not very good with chopsticks 
I'm not willing to take that risk 
I'm often mistaken for my brother 
I'm pretty sure Tom can afford it 
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do that 
I'm proud to have Tom as a friend 
I'm proud to have you on our team 
I'm really bad at stuff like that 
I'm really too drunk for this now 
I'm really worried about my child 
I'm skimming his report right now 
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse 
I'm sorry I can't be of more help 
I'm sorry I forgot to wake you up 
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work 
I'm sorry for having deceived you 
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings 
I'm sorry that I can't come today 
I'm sorry, but I don't understand 
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now 
I'm sorry, we don't accept checks 
I'm spending the evening with Tom 
I'm suffering from a bad headache 
I'm sure Tom will be here shortly 
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam 
I'm sure that I'll miss Tom a lot 
I'm sure you'll like your new job 
I'm surprised you weren't invited 
I'm taking pictures of the bridge 
I'm taking tomorrow afternoon off 
I'm talking to one of my students 
I'm the black sheep of the family 
I'm the luckiest man in the world 
I'm the one who taught Tom French 
I'm thinking about something else 
I'm tired and I want to go to bed 
I'm tired of picking up after you 
I'm trying to eat more vegetables 
I'm twice as busy as I was before 
I'm warning you for the last time 
I'm worried about Tom being alone 
I'm young, but I'm not that young 
I've already done that once today 
I've already finished my homework 
I've asked Tom to stop doing that 
I've been a teacher for two years 
I've been in Boston since October 
I've been looking for you all day 
I've been retired for three years 
I've been thinking of you all day 
I've been waiting all day for you 
I've been waiting for this moment 
I've been waiting for you all day 
I've been working here since 2013 
I've climbed Mt  Fuji three times 
I've come all the way from Boston 
I've cooked you a nice hot dinner 
I've decided to continue studying 
I've despised Tom for a long time 
I've done things I'm not proud of 
I've enjoyed this novel very much 
I've got a class in a few minutes 
I've got almost everything I need 
I've got nothing to say right now 
I've got to do something about it 
I've got to go to church tomorrow 
I've had no problems with my boss 
I've heard no complaints from Tom 
I've just been to the post office 
I've known Tom since I was little 
I've known Tom since we were kids 
I've known her since I was little 
I've learned a good deal from you 
I've made the same mistake myself 
I've managed to stop the bleeding 
I've never been more proud of you 
I've never been this happy before 
I've never felt better in my life 
I've never had a traffic accident 
I've never had to go there before 
I've never heard Tom speak French 
I've never mentioned it to anyone 
I've never played tennis with Tom 
I've never read a novel in French 
I've never seen Tom act like that 
I've never seen him wearing jeans 
I've never taught anyone anything 
I've never told a joke in my life 
I've never told anyone about this 
I've persuaded Tom not to do that 
I've read that book several times 
I've spent 500 dollars in one day 
I've started playing guitar again 
Iceland used to belong to Denmark 
If I were rich, I would go abroad 
If Tom does that, I'll eat my hat 
If Tom doesn't go, I won't either 
If anything can go wrong, it will 
If it rains, bring the washing in 
If only I'd hadn't stayed so long!
If something goes wrong, call Tom 
If that happens again, I'll leave 
If you can't beat them, join them 
If you don't want it, I'll eat it 
If you need anything, let me know 
If you'd listen, you'd understand 
Imagine yourself on a mountaintop 
In India, cows are sacred animals 
In Japan people drive on the left 
In any case, it's always my fault 
In case of a fire, use the stairs 
In case of an emergency, dial 110 
In my dream, I encountered a wolf 
In my opinion, we should hire Tom 
In spring, the days become longer 
In that case, I'll change my mind 
In the long run, prices will rise 
Is French pronunciation difficult?
Is Tom the one who took you there?
Is Tom too young to play baseball?
Is it all right if I call you Tom?
Is it too late for us to register?
Is it true that you came by plane?
Is now a good time to talk to Tom?
Is she still working as a teacher?
Is something wrong with your eyes?
Is that all you have to say to me?
Is that supposed to be a question?
Is that the map that Tom gave you?
Is the exhibit open to the public?
Is the hotel close to the airport?
Is the road all right to drive on?
Is there a cash machine near here?
Is there a restaurant around here?
Is there a youth hostel near here?
Is there another word for synonym?
Is there any place you want to go?
Is there anything else you'd like?
Is there anything new on the menu?
Is there enough food for everyone?
Is there space for another person?
Is this made out of wood or metal?
Is this really all that important?
Is this the right train for Tokyo?
Is this your first visit to Japan?
Is your new computer working well?
Is your school far from your home?
Isn't Tom supposed to be the boss?
Isn't talking about dreams boring?
Isn't that the Golden Gate Bridge?
Isn't that what you always wanted?
It appears that he was in a hurry 
It cost less than fifteen dollars 
It could just be your imagination 
It doesn't look very fun, does it?
It doesn't seem possible, does it?
It happened between eight and ten 
It has been raining since Tuesday 
It has never snowed on the island 
It has no bearing on this problem 
It is a great pleasure to be here 
It is a lot of fun to drive a car 
It is a very difficult job for us 
It is better for you to do it now 
It is better to ignore this point 
It is dangerous to drink too much 
It is easy to answer the question 
It is hard for me to believe this 
It is illegal to park a car there 
It is not a matter to laugh about 
It is not always cold in Hokkaido 
It is not far away from the hotel 
It is not good to laugh at others 
It is not worthwhile saving money 
It is of little consequence to me 
It is premature to discuss it now 
It is probable that she will come 
It is time you told her the truth 
It is too expensive for me to buy 
It is used by a great many people 
It is very hot here in the summer 
It is very kind of you to help me 
It isn't worth repairing this car 
It looks fun  Why don't we try it?
It looks like Tom decided to stay 
It looks like Tom is disappointed 
It looks like Tom is disorganized 
It looks like we fell into a trap 
It looks like we're being ignored 
It looks like you had a tough day 
It looks like your dog is thirsty 
It makes no difference who I meet 
It must be wonderful to live here 
It never pays to lose your temper 
It rained for three days in a row 
It rains a lot here in the spring 
It seems like he knows the secret 
It seems that I'm not lucky today 
It seems that he is telling a lie 
It seems that he knows everything 
It seems that the diamond is real 
It seems that they have quarreled 
It takes three hours to get there 
It was a contemptible thing to do 
It was a waste of time and effort 
It was almost noon when I woke up 
It was almost too good to be true 
It was just a passing infatuation 
It was quite dark when I got home 
It was the worst night of my life 
It was very cold, but we went out 
It was very nice seeing you again 
It was where Tom said it would be 
It wasn't Tom's idea  It was mine 
It wasn't difficult to understand 
It wasn't exactly a piece of cake 
It wasn't supposed to be this way 
It will begin snowing before long 
It would be nice to see Tom again 
It would be sad if that were true 
It'll be finished in a day or two 
It's Tom's 30th birthday tomorrow 
It's a cloak-and-dagger operation 
It's a fairly complicated problem 
It's a full-time, year-around job 
It's a good way to relieve stress 
It's a great conversation starter 
It's a quotation from Don Quixote 
It's a whole new ball game for me 
It's a wonder they're still awake 
It's about time you got a haircut 
It's almost impossible to imagine 
It's already ten o'clock at night 
It's always a pleasure to see you 
It's clearly Tom's responsibility 
It's doubtful whether Tom can win 
It's easy to answer your question 
It's eight o'clock in the morning 
It's hard to get people to change 
It's hard to understand his ideas 
It's kind of you to drive me home 
It's mean of you to talk that way 
It's more trouble than it's worth 
It's naive of you to believe that 
It's not blood  It's tomato sauce 
It's not difficult to learn Dutch 
It's not like Tom to get so angry 
It's now time for me to go to bed 
It's probably just my imagination 
It's prohibited in most countries 
It's raining, but we'll go anyway 
It's really difficult to describe 
It's starting to get dark outside 
It's still snowing pretty heavily 
It's strange that nobody knows us 
It's the best-kept secret in town 
It's the only possible conclusion 
It's time to get down to business 
It's too bad you've caught a cold 
It's too dark here to read a book 
It's too hot to wear a turtleneck 
It's warm here all the year round 
Italy is a very beautiful country 
I’m learning Chinese in Beijing 
I’ve started learning Esperanto 
John is two years older than I am 
Just don't do anything stupid, OK?
Just say whatever you want to say 
Karima hasn't read the letter yet 
Keep an eye on my bag for a while 
Keep the child away from the pond 
Keep your room as neat as you can 
Kelly brought the matter to light 
Kenya used to be a British colony 
Kobe is the city where I was born 
Korean food is generally very hot 
Kyoto is visited by many tourists 
Lack of sleep is bad for the body 
Learning languages is interesting 
Leave a message and I'll call you 
Leave your message after the beep 
Let me give you a piece of advice 
Let me have a look at the picture 
Let me help you with your baggage 
Let me introduce my sister to you 
Let me know what I can do to help 
Let me sleep for ten more minutes 
Let's do only one thing at a time 
Let's drink a few glasses of beer 
Let's go as soon as Tom gets here 
Let's hope we did the right thing 
Let's leave that matter for later 
Let's make sure nothing is wasted 
Let's not wait for Tom any longer 
Let's pretend this never happened 
Let's pretend we didn't hear that 
Let's see if Tom is in his office 
Let's see what tonight will bring 
Let's see what we're dealing with 
Let's solve this problem together 
Let's start with something simple 
Let's take your temperature first 
Let's talk about that over drinks 
Let's wait until it stops raining 
Life isn't all roses and sunshine 
Like it or not, you have to do it 
Listening to music is lots of fun 
Look after the cat while I'm away 
Look at how white Tom's teeth are 
Look at the sports car over there 
Look at this large map of America 
Mail this letter tomorrow morning 
Make sure that you do it yourself 
Many Americans opposed the treaty 
Many kinds of birds live in Japan 
Mary and Alice are sisters-in-law 
Mary brought her daughter to work 
Mary can't have any more children 
Mary didn't even let Tom kiss her 
Mary doesn't look like her mother 
Mary doesn't usually wear jewelry 
Mary had never worn a sari before 
Mary is Tom's first and only love 
Mary is a very good-looking woman 
Mary is beautiful and intelligent 
Mary is going to help us tomorrow 
Mary is more beautiful than Alice 
Mary is wearing a new dress today 
Mary is wearing some sexy clothes 
Mary is young, but full of talent 
Mary isn't the right girl for Tom 
Mary looks good in that red dress 
Mary often wears too much perfume 
Mary put some flowers in the vase 
Mary spends hours in the bathroom 
Mary thought she could change Tom 
Mary took out the eggs one by one 
Mary wants to marry a millionaire 
Mary was arrested for shoplifting 
Mary was desperate to get married 
Mary wiped her hands on her apron 
Mary wishes she had straight hair 
Mary's dress is drying in the sun 
May I ask you a personal question?
May I ask you some more questions?
May I ask you what your weight is?
May I have your attention, please?
May I wash all my laundry at once?
Maybe I gave Tom the wrong advice 
Maybe I haven't explained it well 
Maybe I just need some time alone 
Maybe I should write Tom a letter 
Maybe Tom went shopping with Mary 
Maybe you shouldn't be doing that 
Meat won't keep long in this heat

No decent people go to that place 
No meal is complete without bread 
No medicine can cure this disease 
No one I know wears a tie anymore 
No one can understand your letter

I can't work with you if you don't trust me 
I congratulated him on the birth of his son 
I could barely speak French three years ago 
I could be wrong, but I think Tom likes you 
I couldn't fall asleep because of the noise 
I couldn't have done that without your help 
I couldn't have done this without your help

I don't want to make a big deal out of this 
I don't want to participate in the ceremony 
I don't want to work under these conditions 
I don't want you to see my daughter anymore 
I doubt that he can make a speech in public 
I dreamed I was in a very strange situation 
I entered the room and shook hands with him 
I expect Tom has his reasons for doing that 
I feel cold  Do you mind closing the window?
I feel like I've already been here sometime 
I feel like doing something different today 
I feel like telling him what I think of him 
I fell asleep while I was doing my homework

I have no more than one hundred yen with me 
I have not been sick for the past ten years 
I have people over to my place all the time 
I have plenty of time, but not enough money 
I have something I need to discuss with Tom 
I have three times as many books as he does 
I have to change the batteries in the radio 
I have to find a way to earn a lot of money 
I have to find a way to make a lot of money 
I have to finish up some things before I go 
I have to go even if it rains cats and dogs 
I have to set my watch back  It's very fast 
I have written many plays, but never a poem 
I haven't been able to remember her address 
I haven't been back here since the incident 
I haven't eaten Chinese food in a long time 
I haven't had a chance to see the movie yet 
I haven't talked to Tom for quite some time 
I hear his business is on the verge of ruin 
I hear that you're very good at what you do 
I heard that you are also collecting stamps 
I heard that, but I didn't know it was true 
I hope Tom will tell me what I need to know 
I hope to see reindeer on my trip to Sweden 
I hope we'll be seeing you around here soon 
I hurried in order to catch the first train 
I just can't stand this hot weather anymore 
I just want a straight answer  Nothing more 
I just want to be your friend, nothing more 
I just want to know why you brought me here 
I just want to talk with you a little while 
I know Tom and Mary used to be good friends 
I know Tom wants us to go swimming with him 
I know my daughter better than anybody else 
I know somebody who speaks French very well 
I know that Tom is afraid to try new things 
I know what kind of people Tom and Mary are 
I know you're going through a lot right now 
I know you're hiding somewhere in this room 
I learned many of Takuboku's poems by heart 
I learned to play the guitar when I was ten 
I left my new pair of gloves in the library 
I like jazz  What kind of music do you like?
I live near her house, but I seldom see her 
I lived in Australia for almost three years 
I lost my best friend in a traffic accident 
I love the smell of pancakes in the morning 
I majored in American literature at college 
I met Tom for the first time three days ago 
I met her in a coffee shop near the station 
I must finish reading that book by tomorrow 
I must've lost my wallet in the supermarket 
I need a pair of scissors to cut this paper 
I need a place to stay for a couple of days 
I need that information as soon as possible 
I need to find out who gave Tom that advice 
I need to know what they were talking about 
I need you to find out what happened to Tom 
I needed your help, but I couldn't find you 
I never learned about any of this in school 
I never learned how to use a microwave oven 
I only have toast and coffee in the morning 
I only live here because it's close to work 
I only speak French at home with my parents 
I pay him twice as much as his old boss did 
I personally don't have anything against it 
I plan to go  I don't care if you do or not 
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are 
I promised my parents that I'd study French 
I ran across her in Mongolia, of all places 
I ran as fast as I could to catch the train 
I read an article about acid rain yesterday 
I really think you should put some pants on 
I really want to know what's happening here 
I remember having seen him somewhere before 
I remember the first time I heard this song 
I remember the happy days we spent together 
I said nothing, which made him more furious 
I sat behind a very tall man in the theater 
I saw Tom here in the park just a while ago 
I saw immediately that he was uncomfortable 
I see no reason to continue this discussion 
I should've listened to Tom instead of Mary 
I should've listened to what my mother said 
I shouldn't have gone to Boston without you 
I shouldn't have played outside in the rain 
I showed my friends these picture postcards 
I soon got accustomed to speaking in public 
I spend a lot of time practicing the guitar 
I stayed at my uncle's while I was in Tokyo 
I stayed up late last night reading a novel 
I still think we should've told Tom to come 
I stopped smoking for the sake of my health 
I suggest you give your old computer to Tom 
I talked my wife out of buying a new carpet 
I think I might be able to be there by 2:30 
I think I mistakenly sent that email to Tom 
I think I've had a little too much to drink 
I think Tom did exactly what he said he did 
I think Tom is only pretending to be asleep 
I think Tom isn't the right man for the job 
I think everyone gets a bit lonely at times 
I think he regrets having divorced his wife 
I think it's time for me to go back to work 
I think it's time for me to turn off the TV 
I think it's time for me to wash this shirt 
I think it's unlikely that plants feel pain 
I think my boyfriend is spying on my emails 
I think that watching TV is a waste of time 
I think there has been some kind of mistake 
I think there's something we're overlooking 
I think we should wait another half an hour 
I think you haven't understood the question 
I think you spend too much time watching TV 
I think you're asking too much for this hat 
I think you've mistaken me for someone else 
I think you've read too many romance novels 
I thought I'd try eating Mexican food today 
I thought about the meaning of his painting 
I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me 
I thought that Tom might be able to help us 
I thought we settled that matter last night 
I thought you were going to ask us to leave 
I told Tom I didn't need to do that anymore 
I told Tom how much I valued Mary's opinion 
I told her to give up on that crazy thought 
I told you this was going to be interesting 
I took a taxi from the station to the hotel 
I turned on the radio to listen to the news 
I understand you had a little talk with Tom 
I waited for my husband till after midnight 
I walk my dog along the river every morning 
I want Tom to tell me what he meant by that 
I want my children to have dual citizenship 
I want my children to learn to speak French 
I want to continue this discussion tomorrow 
I want to get a connecting flight to Boston 
I want to know exactly what you said to Tom 
I want to know that what I'm doing is right 
I want to take a closer look at that report 
I want to thank you all for a job well done 
I want you and Tom working together on this 
I want you to listen to what Tom has to say 
I want you to start taking things seriously 
I wanted Tom to have a copy of my new novel 
I wanted to say thank you for all your help 
I wanted to talk to you about what happened 
I was able to answer the question correctly 
I was able to do that much quicker than Tom 
I was about to reply, when he boldly cut in 
I was absent from school because I was sick 
I was absent from school because of illness 
I was at the hospital with Tom when he died 
I was disappointed that she was not at home 
I was having a bath when the telephone rang 
I was in Boston for almost the whole summer 
I was in the area, so I thought I'd drop by 
I was in trouble with the police last night 
I was kidnapped when I was twelve years old 
I was one of the best students in the class 
I was penniless when I arrived in Australia 
I was the one who stole Mary's diamond ring 
I was told that we need to be there by 2:30 
I was very impressed by Tom's good behavior 
I wasn't aware that someone was watching me 
I wasn't lying when I said that I loved you 
I water the flowers in the garden every day 
I went to see a movie with Tom after school 
I will do my duty to the best of my ability 
I will get these shoes repaired by tomorrow 
I will give you a bicycle for your birthday 
I will go for a walk if it is nice tomorrow 
I will have finished my homework by Tuesday 
I wish I could figure out how to burn a DVD 
I wish I had gone to the theater last night 
I wish things could've happened differently 
I wonder what happened between Tom and Mary 
I wonder whether Tom is really in Australia 
I wonder whether Tom will sign the contract 
I wonder who the people I saw her with were 
I wonder why the police didn't find the gun 
I wondered why Tom didn't have a girlfriend 
I worked hard in order to support my family 
I would hate to be in Tom's shoes right now 
I would like to express my gratitude to her 
I would rather stay at home than go fishing 
I'd be grateful if you didn't do that again 
I'd like it if you would cook dinner for me 
I'd like some coffee if you are making some 
I'd like to ask one or two questions myself 
I'd like to dedicate this song to my mother 
I'd like to find a way to improve my memory 
I'd like to go with you, but I really can't 
I'd like to have more time to talk with you 
I'd like to improve my French pronunciation 
I'd like to pay with my credit card instead 
I'd like to show this picture of Tom to you 
I'd like to thank all our guests for coming 
I'd like you to attend the meeting tomorrow 
I'd like you to have a thorough examination 
I'd prefer not to get home until after 2:30 
I'd rather go for a walk than see the movie 
I'll be here all morning if anyone needs me 
I'll call for you at eight tomorrow morning 
I'll come visit you at your office tomorrow 
I'll even buy you a new car if you want one 
I'll give you another chance if you want it 
I'll guarantee that you'll enjoy this movie 
I'll make sure Tom does that sometime today 
I'll mow the lawn tomorrow, unless it rains 
I'll never be able to explain what happened 
I'll never forget the day that we first met 
I'll never forget the day when we first met 
I'll never forget what Tom told me that day 
I'll probably come back here again tomorrow 
I'll take care of the dog while you are out 
I'll take my passport with me, just in case 
I'll visit my uncle in Australia next month 
I'm afraid that there isn't any coffee left 
I'm ashamed that my son is such a lazybones 
I'm better at riding a unicycle than Tom is 
I'm certain Tom will want to speak with you 
I'm concerned about my wife's hacking cough 
I'm driving to Boston tomorrow to visit Tom 
I'm familiar with the way he asks questions 
I'm glad to hear that you're getting better 
I'm glad to see you enjoy your work so much 
I'm going to have two pieces in her gallery 
I'm going to stay in Australia until Monday 
I'm going to talk to Tom when he comes home 
I'm going to travel to Australia next month 
I'm going to watch TV for a couple of hours 
I'm impressed with how much you've improved 
I'm interested in doing that, but Tom isn't 
I'm just going to answer the call of nature 
I'm just kidding  That really didn't happen 
I'm likely going to be fired for doing that 
I'm looking for a book about medieval Spain 
I'm looking forward to going to the concert 
I'm looking forward to meeting your parents 
I'm looking forward to the return of spring 
I'm meeting Tom for dinner  Do want to come?
I'm not a child  Don't talk to me like I am 
I'm not a coward, but I'm not stupid either 
I'm not even sure if that would help or not 
I'm not sure if I like this one or that one 
I'm not sure whether to stay home or go out 
I'm not surprised you don't know the answer 
I'm planning to buy a mobile phone tomorrow 
I'm pretty sure I'll pass the test tomorrow 
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do anything crazy 
I'm really hungry  I haven't eaten all week 
I'm saving up so that I can go to Australia 
I'm sick of eating the same thing every day 
I'm sorry that I didn't reply to you sooner 
I'm sorry to say I don't remember your name 
I'm sorry, but I am opposed to this project 
I'm sorry, but I think that you're mistaken 
I'm staying with my aunt for the time being 
I'm sure I can find something for you to do 
I'm sure Tom will like the gift you got him 
I'm sure you've seen everything you need to 
I'm surprised by her lack of responsability 
I'm surprised that Tom doesn't speak French 
I'm taking my son to the zoo this afternoon 
I'm the one who recommended Tom for the job 
I'm the only one who stayed awake all night 
I'm very interested in classical literature 
I'm visiting my grandmother in the hospital 
I'm worried about the state of Tom's health 
I've already said I don't know how to do it 
I've already told Tom what needs to be done 
I've already told you all I know about that 
I've always gotten along very well with Tom 
I've always wanted to go to another country 
I've always wanted to travel through Europe 
I've always wanted to visit another country 
I've asked you several times not to do that 
I've been waiting for you since two o'clock 
I've been working in Boston for three years 
I've been working with Tom for three months 
I've given up on the idea of buying a house 
I've got to figure out what I'm doing wrong 
I've lost my umbrella  I must buy a new one 
I've never done anything illegal in my life 
I've never had this kind of problem at work 
I've never heard Tom say anything like that 
I've never seen so many people in one place 
I've seen Tom play peek-a-boo with his baby 
If I had enough money, I would buy the book 
If I had enough time, I would talk with you 
If I knew her address, I would write to her 
If I knew his address, I would write to him 
If Tom can do it, I'm sure I can do it, too 
If it were not for water, we could not live 
If the food's cold, put it in the microwave 
If you are to succeed, you must work harder 
If you could come tomorrow, that'd be great 
If you did that for me, it would help a lot 
If you do that for me, I'll be in your debt 
If you don't study, you won't pass the exam 
If you don't tell Tom what happened, I will 
If you don't understand, you need to say so 
If you have something to say, please say it 
If you keep trying, you'll get better at it 
If you push this button, the door will open 
If you won a million yen, what would you do?
In bad weather, one can easily catch a cold 
In each beehive there can only be one queen 
In order to do that, you have to take risks 
In the future, you have to get here on time 
In the past, there was never this much snow 
Instead of going myself, I sent a messenger 
Is it true Tom is one of your close friends?
Is it true that you closed the shop at nine?
Is it true that your girlfriend is Japanese?
Is there anyone who can pronounce this word?
Is there anything that I can do to help you?
Is there something that you want to tell me?
Isn't there something you want to say to me?
It doesn't cost anything, but it takes time 
It doesn't matter whether you answer or not 
It doesn't seem to make much sense, does it?
It has been raining heavily for three hours 
It is a pity that you cannot travel with us 
It is about 1 mile from here to the station 
It is better to live rich, than to die rich 
It is clear that we cannot live without air 
It is courageous of you to say such a thing 
It is crazy of you to put your life at risk 
It is dangerous to jump onto a moving train 
It is difficult for me to get up before six 
It is easy to be brave from a safe distance 
It is hard for foreigners to learn Japanese 
It is hard to adapt this story for children 
It is illegal to sell cigarettes to a minor 
It is impossible for us to cross that river 
It is no use trying to convince him of that 
It looks like we're almost out of the woods 
It looks like you've put on a little weight 
It might be better to address her as Doctor 
It might rain  We'd better take an umbrella 
It occurred to me that he was the right man 
It probably would be cheaper somewhere else 
It seemed impossible that Tom would succeed 
It seems a waste of time to wait any longer 
It seems something's wrong with my computer 
It seems that they're bored of married life 
It seems to me that you're making fun of me 
It seldom snows in this part of the country 
It takes years to master a foreign language 
It took three days to paint the whole house 
It was Tom's idea, not mine  Don't blame me 
It was a dry year, and many animals starved 
It was a new experience for almost everyone 
It was a race to get to the station on time 
It was a sunny day when we went to the mall 
It was difficult to remove the coffee stain 
It was extremely hot, so I took my coat off 
It was gambling that brought about his ruin 
It was hard for Tom to keep a straight face 
It was her little sister that broke her toy 
It was just something I read in a newspaper 
It was much worse than we initially thought 
It was not very cold, but it was always wet 
It was obvious that Tom wanted to kiss Mary 
It was stupid of him to turn down her offer 
It was unfortunate that it rained yesterday 
It was you that suggested seeing that movie 
It won't be hard to find someone to do that 
It won't be long before everything is ready 
It would be nice if I could travel to Japan 
It would have been wiser to leave it unsaid 
It would take forever to explain everything 
It'll be easy to finish this job by Tuesday 
It's a pity that Mary has no sense of humor 
It's a pity you didn't tell somebody sooner 
It's a shame the way old people are treated 
It's at least three hundred miles from here 
It's been a while since I've ridden a horse 
It's been three years since Tom left Boston 
It's essential that you eat more vegetables 
It's getting late, so we'd better get going 
It's good to try new things once in a while 
It's great to see you're having so much fun 
It's hard for me to live on my small income 
It's impossible for me to explain it to you 
It's impossible to learn English in a month 
It's impossible to sleep with so much noise 
It's no use thinking about one's lost youth 
It's not a good idea to pick up hitchhikers 
It's not a snake  It's only a piece of rope 
It's not known who first invented the wheel 
It's not legal to keep wild animals as pets 
It's obvious that she doesn't care about us 
It's raining, so please bring your umbrella 
It's really dark here  I can't see anything 
It's rude to ask someone how much they earn 
It's six of one and a half dozen of another 
It's so warm in this room that I'm sweating 
It's the best French restaurant in New York 
It's time to establish the religion of love 
It's too bad you can't stay a little longer 
It's up to you how you spend your free time 
It's very easy to miss this kind of mistake 
I’ve always wanted to have a pet squirrel 
Japan imports great quantities of crude oil 
Japan plays a key role in the world economy 
Japanese people are considered to be polite 
Just a second  This call might be important 
Just give me what you owe me and I'll leave 
Kansas is smack dab in the middle of the US 
Keep the engine running  I'll be right back 
Kunihiko hit the target with his first shot 
Kyoto is famous for its shrines and temples 
Leaves were dropping silently to the ground 
Let me take a look at your driver's license 
Let's compare this dictionary with that one 
Let's eat the ice cream now before it melts 
Let's have a serious talk about your future 
Let's not fool ourselves about that project 
Let's not forget the real reason we're here 
Let's pitch the tent while it's still light

Mary fell in love with a handsome young man 
Mary is just as beautiful as Alice, I think

Mary is wearing two sweaters under her coat 
Mary knitted Tom a sweater for his birthday 
Mary likes to dress up on special occasions 
Mary said that she thought Tom was innocent 
Mary's parents were very impressed with Tom 
Maternal love is greater than anything else

Shakespeare wrote many beautiful love poems 
Shaving doesn't make your beard grow faster 
She accused him of being inattentive to her 
She acknowledged that my statement was true 
She advised him that he should stay at home 
She as well as her friends is fond of music 
She can hardly wait for the summer vacation 
She cheered him up because he was depressed 
She claims that she knows nothing about him 
She could not get over her fear of the dark 
She could solve the problem, and so could I 
She couldn't convince him to come back home 
She couldn't study abroad for lack of money 
She did not keep her promise to write to me 
She didn't know what to do with the problem 
She didn't run fast enough to catch the bus

She'd like him to come to her house at 2:30 
She's about the same age as my older sister 
She's been absent from school for five days 
She's been wearing the same hat for a month 
She's not the kind of girl you think she is

Shouldn't we be doing something to help Tom?
Shut up  If you don't, you'll be thrown out

Start reading where you left off 
Stop acting like a spoiled child 
Stop it  You're being ridiculous 
Stop worrying and get some sleep 
Stop! There's a deer on the road 
Stories often have happy endings 
Success depends mostly on effort 
Such measures were not necessary 
Suddenly all the lights went out 
Suddenly, he changed the subject 
Sunflowers are beautiful flowers 
Supplies of oil are not infinite 
Swimming in the sea is great fun 
Swimming is good for your health 
Switzerland is a neutral country 
Take as many cookies as you want 
Take as many peaches as you like 
Take as many peaches as you want 
Take the children into the house 
Take this medicine between meals 
Take your time  There's no hurry 
Talking during a concert is rude 
Taxi fares will go up next month 
Tell Tom I'd like to talk to him 
Tell Tom he has to do that today 
Tell Tom that I'll call him back 
Tell her that I am taking a bath 
Tell me how to solve the problem 
Tell me something about yourself 
Tell me why you want to go there 
Telling lies is a very bad habit 
Ten years is a long time to wait 
Thank you for building this wall 
Thank you for calling me on time 
Thank you for fixing my car, Tom 
Thank you for the Christmas gift 
Thank you for the wonderful gift 
Thank you for the wonderful meal 
Thank you for your understanding 
Thank you so much for helping me 
Thanks for helping me fix my car 
Thanks to you, I arrived on time 
That box is bigger than this one 
That child has a very large head 
That company produces microchips 
That didn't stop Tom from trying 
That doesn't mean anything to me 
That hotel is very near the lake 
That hotel serves very good food 
That is the house where he lives 
That isn't actually what I meant 
That kind of story appeals to me 
That makes you happy, doesn't it?
That man didn't give me his name 
That medicine worked well for me 
That meeting was a waste of time 
That name doesn't ring any bells 
That nickname fits him perfectly 
That old man caught a large fish 
That patient may die at any time 
That place is said to be haunted 
That plane will take off at five 
That play was an immense success 
That red dress looks good on her 
That shouldn't have been allowed 
That small star is the brightest 
That sounds credible, doesn't it?
That was a new experience for me 
That was my first visit to Japan 
That was obviously a stupid idea 
That was only a figure of speech 
That was the best day of my life 
That was very considerate of Tom 
That won't be any problem at all 
That wouldn't have happened here 
That'll be seven dollars, please 
That'll cause a lot of criticism 
That's a beautiful piece of meat 
That's a hard question to answer 
That's a secret I can't tell you 
That's a very difficult question 
That's a very interesting theory 
That's an interesting suggestion 
That's an overly optimistic view 
That's certainly one possibility 
That's exactly what Tom is doing 
That's exactly what you need now 
That's going to happen very soon 
That's just the way she likes it 
That's not a proper thing to say 
That's not exactly what happened 
That's not how you spell my name 
That's only a temporary solution 
That's really not the same thing 
That's surely a misunderstanding 
That's the book I told you about 
That's the most important reason 
That's the village I was born in 
That's what I want to understand 
That's what I'm asking you to do 
That's what Tom keeps telling me 
That's what you don't understand 
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
That's when I knew Tom was lying 
That's why I came to talk to you 
That's why Tom doesn't like Mary 
That's why you're here, isn't it?

The heat kept me awake all night 
The honor is more than I deserve

The house collapsed a week later 
The house fell down a week later 
The hunter was skinning the deer 
The ice cracked under the weight 
The installation is now complete 
The island is very easy to reach 
The job isn't anywhere near done

The measurements must be precise 
The medicine gave instant relief 
The medicine made me very sleepy 
The meeting took place yesterday 
The message is written in French

The old castle is in a sad state 
The old man lives on his pension 
The old man was starved to death 
The onions have already sprouted 
The only person sleeping was Tom 
The only thing we can do is wait 
The other day, I bought a camera 
The pain has started to ease now 
The painting is all but finished 
The paper didn't carry the story 
The paperback version is cheaper 
The park is filled with children 
The patient is now out of danger 
The patient is out of danger now

The ring was nowhere to be found 
The river flows under the bridge 
The room is being painted by him 
The room is too small to play in 
The room was devoid of furniture 
The rumor is true to some extent 
The rumor turned out to be false 
The rumor was without foundation 
The school is on top of the hill 
The second lesson is very simple 
The ship gradually came in sight 
The ship wasn't ready for battle 
The shooting started around noon 
The sick man's life is in danger 
The sign indicates the way to go 
The singer has a beautiful voice 
The situation there was critical

The snow was several meters deep 
The sooner you leave, the better 
The speech lasted thirty minutes 
The square of nine is eighty-one 
The squirrel climbed up the tree 
The stars are shining in the sky 
The statement is not wholly true 
The station is not far from here 
The storm caused a lot of damage 
The streets aren't safe at night 
The streets in Hokkaido are wide 
The student insulted the teacher 
The students ought to study more

The water flows under the bridge 
The water was calm and very blue 
The way you're doing it is wrong 
The whole class is present today 
The wind slammed the door closed 
The word is not in my dictionary 
The work is practically finished 
The work is progressing steadily 
The young adapt to change easily 
Their carpet is completely white 
There are 50 members in the club 
There are a few books in the bag 
There are four seasons in a year 
There are many cultures on Earth 
There are many mysteries in life 
There are many parks in our town 
There are no chairs in this room 
There are only 24 hours in a day 
There are only two possibilities 
There are some books on the desk 
There are three cows in the barn 
There exists only one option now 
There is a big market for coffee 
There is a television in my room 
There is an apple under the desk

There is no hope of his recovery 
There is no need for him to work 
There is no reason for this fear 
There is no sign of life on Mars 
There is no time for explanation 
There is nothing to be scared of 
There is nothing wrong with this 
There is one thing I want to ask 
There is some milk in the fridge 
There is the train at 10 o'clock 
There isn't going to be a change 
There may be a problem with that 
There must be a misunderstanding 
There should be a law against it 
There was a calm after the storm 
There was a heavy rain yesterday 
There was a light rain yesterday 
There was a strong wind that day 
There was food enough for us all 
There was no way of reaching Tom 
There was obviously no other way 
There was only one small problem 
There wasn't a living soul there 
There were a lot of people there 
There were five fires last night 
There were three men in the room 
There were too many people there 
There's a call for you  It's Tom 
There's a church behind my house 
There's a house behind the trees 
There's a spider inside the tent 
There's a white dove on the roof 
There's also another possibility 
There's an alley behind my house 
There's no cure for this disease 
There's no fool like an old fool 
There's no need to speak so loud 
There's no one by that name here 
There's no one here by that name 
There's no other way to say this 
There's no way to save everybody 
There's nobody here by that name 
There's nothing left for me here 
There's only one way out of here 
There's something I have to know 
There's something fishy going on 
There's something wrong with Tom 
Thermometers often go below zero 
These allegations are ridiculous 
These colors harmonize very well 
These gloves kept her hands warm 
These grapes are too sour to eat 
These houses were dark and dirty 
These pencils are the same color 
These people hate all foreigners 
These records are 2,000 yen each 
These shoes are too small for me 
These trees were planted by them 
They agreed on a joint statement 
They appointed him as a director 
They are accustomed to hard work 
They are both colleagues of mine 
They are expected any minute now 
They are in danger of extinction 
They are looking to you for help 
They are proud of their daughter 
They are putting on their gloves 
They are the ones who want to go 
They are very popular among boys 
They avoided each other for days 
They blamed him for the accident 
They broke down part of the wall 
They broke into the jewelry shop 
They came here one after another 
They could barely make ends meet 
They could not find work at home 
They didn't even know themselves 
They didn't even know what to do 
They enjoy one another's company 
They expected the British to win 
They fell into each other's arms 
They figured it out on their own 
They gave him a chance to escape 
They go into town every Saturday 
They had great fun at my expense 
They had had that problem before 
They had to stay at home all day 
They have very little to live on 
They hurried by without a glance 
They kissed each other goodnight 
They made the same mistake again 
They mistook him for his brother 
They moved in just the other day 
They rushed towards their mother 
They shook hands with each other 
They stayed at a five-star hotel 
They stepped a few paces forward 
They stood up for what was right 
They surprised the enemy at dawn 
They talked over a cup of coffee 
They tortured my father to death 
They went in opposite directions 
They were a match made in heaven 
They were badly in need of water 
They were better than I expected 
They were criticizing each other 
They were destined never to meet

You always take the lion's share!
You always were good at your job 
You and Tom have a lot in common 
You are entitled to your opinion 
You are exactly like your father

You don't seem to be very hungry 
You don't want to seem desperate 
You forgot to turn off the light 
You had better not go after dark 
You had better not see her today 
You handled that very skillfully 
You have good reason to be angry 
You have only three minutes left 
You have only to watch what I do 
You have to answer this question 
You have to believe in something 
You have to make Tom believe you 
You have to see it to believe it 
You have to tighten those screws 
You have until morning to decide

You ought not to stay up so late 
You probably don't recognize her 
You really don't like me, do you?
You really don't need to do that 
You really need to get a haircut 
You really should be helping Tom

You were always such a happy boy 
You were having fun, weren't you?
You were never very good at math 
You were pretending, weren't you?
You will be shocked to hear this 
You will know the truth some day 
You will need time to understand 
You won't believe who I just saw 
You won't need an umbrella today 
You work harder than anyone here 
You wouldn't have recognized Tom 
You wouldn't have won without me 
You'd better consult your doctor 
You'll be better off without Tom 
You'll be hearing from my lawyer 
You'll be missed by your friends 
You'll find this map very useful 
You'll have to ask somebody else 
You'll make Tom a very happy man 
You'll never guess what happened

You're old enough to know better 
You're out of touch with reality 
You're shallow and materialistic 
You're the best dad in the world 
You're the laziest person I know 
You're three years older than me 
You're too young to travel alone 
You're welcome here anytime, Tom 
You've got the right to be happy

You've probably seen a lot worse 
Your French is really quite good

Have you ever stepped on a tomato?
Have you ever traveled in a plane?
Have you heard about the accident?
Have you heard this story already?
Have you met Tom's new girlfriend?
Have you noticed anything strange?
Have you noticed anything unusual?
Have you recovered from the shock?
Have you seen Tom's new apartment?
Have you seen any movies recently?
Have you seen my glasses anywhere?
Have you talked to Tom about this?
He agreed to give us an interview 
He always conceals his intentions 
He annoyed us with his complaints 
He applied for the job and got it 
He asked her to remain in the job 
He asked me the way to the museum 
He asked us not to make any noise 
He bakes bread in a very old oven 
He became financially independent 
He believes everything that I say 
He blew on the tip of his fingers 
He broke the window intentionally 
He brought back several souvenirs 
He built a fence around his house 
He built them on an assembly line 
He came at three in the afternoon 
He came from a tiny mountain town 
He cannot have done it by himself 
He carried on with his experiment 
He congratulated me on my success 
He could not answer that question 
He could still be alive somewhere 
He couldn't resist the temptation 
He cut off a branch from the tree 
He cut off two meters of the rope 
He denied having stolen the money 
He did it simply out of curiosity 
He did not eat anything yesterday 
He did not speak unless spoken to 
He didn't fulfill his obligations 
He didn't go there  Neither did I 
He died and his soul went to hell 
He doesn't care much for baseball 
He doesn't have enough experience 
He doesn't realize what he's lost 
He doesn't seem to be an American 
He doesn't show his true feelings 
He doesn't want to get in trouble 
He doesn't want to get out of bed 
He doubted the truth of her story 
He drank straight from the bottle 
He drinks a lot of milk every day 
He dropped his books on the floor 
He earned his living as a teacher 
He earns three times more than me 
He enlisted in the Foreign Legion 
He examined it from top to bottom 
He excused himself for being late 
He expressed his thanks to us all 
He failed to catch the 8:30 train 
He finally decided to get married 
He forgot his promise to go there 
He forgot his wedding anniversary 
He gave me a good piece of advice 
He gave me a smile of recognition 
He gave me food and money as well 
He gave money to each of his sons 
He gave us quite a lot of trouble 
He gets his hair cut once a month 
He got into the car and drove off 
He got the short end of the stick 
He got up at eight in the morning 
He grows vegetables in his garden 
He had almost no formal education 
He had an absent look on his face 
He had friends all over the world 
He had no distinguishing features 
He had nothing to say, so he left 
He had to work hard day and night 
He had two hundred head of cattle 
He has a large house and two cars 
He has a lot of money in the bank 
He has been teaching for 20 years 
He has been to France three times 
He has been to London three times 
He has gone to Hawaii on vacation 
He has half as many books as I do 
He has more money than he can use 
He has never been late for school 
He has no friends to fall back on 
He has not seen much of the world 
He has this large room to himself 
He has visited France three times 
He heard a noise from the kitchen 
He heard someone calling for help 
He hid his sadness behind a smile 
He imitated the works of Van Gogh 
He invested 500,000 yen in stocks 
He is able to speak ten languages 
He is better today than yesterday 
He is busy preparing for the trip 
He is by nature a generous person 
He is difficult to get along with 
He is half as old again as she is 
He is having difficulty breathing 
He is known to the entire country 
He is not a teacher but a student 
He is not scared of snakes at all 
He is old enough to understand it 
He is rich enough to buy that car 
He is rich enough to buy two cars 
He is still too young for the job 
He is studying in the library now 
He is the best player on our team 
He is the only person for the job 
He is the son of a wealthy family 
He is the stingiest person I know 
He is two inches taller than I am 
He is unsatisfied with the result 
He is very good at playing violin 
He is very sensitive to criticism 
He kindly drove me to the station 
He knows a lot about wild animals 
He knows everything about Germany 
He knows hardly anything about it 
He knows how to close this window 
He knows how to speak to children 
He knows how to talk to customers 
He left the meeting for no reason 
He likes animals more than people 
He likes mathematics, but I don't 
He likes taking a walk by himself 
He lives in that house over there 
He lives somewhere near that park 
He locked himself in the bathroom 
He looked around the waiting room 
He looked at her over his glasses 
He looked back at the pretty girl 
He looks exactly like his brother 
He lost all of his money gambling 
He lost his balance and fell down 
He made a very valuable discovery 
He made his way through the crowd 
He made up a story about the king 
He may have missed the last train 
He may have taken the wrong train 
He mistook me for my twin brother 
He must finish his homework today 
He must have abused the privilege 
He must have gotten over his cold 
He must have studied English hard 
He never fails to do what he says 
He never touches alcoholic drinks 
He often reads far into the night 
He paid no attention to my advice 
He placed his hand on my shoulder 
He plays cello exceptionally well 
He plays the piano better than me 
He pretended that he was a lawyer 
He proceeded to the next question 
He put his head out of the window 
He raised his hand to stop a taxi 
He ran for governor of California 
He read a book written in English 
He resented being called a coward 
He rested his hand on my shoulder 
He returned from abroad yesterday 
He runs a supermarket in the town 
He said good night to his parents 
He said that Tokyo is a safe city 
He said that he wanted some money 
He said there was no life on Mars 
He sat surrounded by his children 
He secretly showed me her picture 
He seems to have a touch of fever 
He seems to have left the country 
He seldom gets angry or irritated 
He set out for Tokyo this morning 
He should have done that long ago 
He showed an interest in the book 
He showed me his photograph album 
He spent much of his time reading 
He talks as if he knew everything 
He talks as if he knew the secret 
He talks as if he were an old man 
He teaches English to his friends 
He took no photos of the festival 
He took part in the Olympic Games 
He tried to attract her attention 
He tried to make up for lost time 
He tried to pull a fast one on me 
He turned over a new leaf in life 
He undertook a great deal of work 
He uses the same books as you use 
He visited many countries in Asia 
He wants to live closer to nature 
He wants us to free the prisoners 
He was at the bottom of the class 
He was exhausted when he got home 
He was fortunate to pass the exam 
He was given an important mission 
He was in good health last summer 
He was in the hospital for a week 
He was jealous of their happiness 
He was raised by his grandparents 
He was satisfied with his new car 
He was scared you would shoot him 
He was sick, so he did not go out 
He was sitting and reading a book 
He was so angry he couldn't speak 
He was the leader of the movement 
He was unconscious for three days 
He was visiting his foster mother 
He went by me without noticing me 
He went out in spite of the storm 
He went out of his way to help me 
He went to Paris by car yesterday 
He went to the hospital yesterday 
He whispered something in her ear 
He whispered the answer in my ear 
He will advise you on that matter 
He will come back sooner or later 
He will come into a large fortune 
He will do anything to make money 
He will go to New York next month 
He will pass the next examination 
He will write an answer very soon 
He will write for hours at a time 
He won a sizeable amount of money 
He worked from morning till night 
He works as a gondolier in Venice 
He works hard and never complains 
He'll be taking an exam next week 
He'll catch up with us in an hour 
He's a little taller than you are 
He's a man of very good character 
He's afraid that he might be late 
He's concealing something from me 
He's eating breakfast in the cafe 
He's going to have a heart attack 
He's intelligent and good-looking 
He's married to an American woman 
He's often mistaken for a student 
He's old enough to be your father 
He's two years older than Mary is 
He's wearing a white cotton shirt 
Help yourself to the cake, please 
Help yourself to the cookies, Tom 
Her answer couldn't be understood 
Her anxiety almost drove her wild 
Her beauty was beyond description 
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey 
Her death was a great shock to me 
Her mother always accompanies her 
Her new hairstyle covers her ears 
Here is a photograph of my family 
Here's some medicine for diarrhea 
Here's someone I want you to meet 
Hey, Tom, can I ask you something?
His behavior is sometimes strange 
His behavior is worthy of respect 
His brave deed earned him respect 
His brother goes to school by bus 
His condition got worse every day 
His family didn't have much money 
His help came in the nick of time 
His house was struck by lightning 
His letter doesn't make any sense 
His office is on the eighth floor 
His policies were too progressive 
His position enabled him to do so 
His sleeve touched the greasy pan 
His son had been killed in a duel 
His speech impressed us very much 
His theory deserves consideration 
His voice was heard above the din 
His wealth has not made him happy 
His work finished, he went to bed 
How about dining out for a change?
How about something cold to drink?
How are you and Tom getting along?
How are you going to convince Tom?
How can I know if a girl likes me?
How can I tell if a girl likes me?
How can you justify your behavior?
How come this never happens to me?
How dare you talk to me like that!
How did Tom cope with the problem?
How did you come by this painting?
How did you find out where I live?
How did you get interested in art?
How did you get so good at French?
How did you hit upon such an idea?
How did you know his name was Tom?
How did you know where to find me?
How did you learn to cook so well?
How did you pay for this computer?
How do we get back home from here?
How do we know that he's innocent?
How do you intend to achieve that?
How do you intend to achieve this?
How do you know they're Canadians?
How do you know this car is Tom's?
How do you know what I'm thinking?
How do you say  thanks  in French?
How do you spell your family name?
How familiar are you with my case?
How far is it from here to Boston?
How important are children to you?
How is your first name pronounced?
How long are you planning to stay?
How long can you hold your breath?
How long did you sleep last night?
How long do you plan to stay here?
How long has Tom been in the cave?
How long have you lived in Boston?
How long were you and Tom married?
How long were you at school today?
How long will you be staying here?
How long you can stand on one leg?
How lucky! There's nothing broken 
How many days are there in a week?
How many hours a day do you sleep?
How many hours a week do you work?
How many months can you stay here?
How many people are at this party?
How many people are you expecting?
How many photos are in this album?
How many times have you done this?
How much distance have we covered?
How much do ten paper plates cost?
How much does Tom know about Mary?
How much does a soccer ball weigh?
How much does your daughter weigh?
How much is your monthly gas bill?
How much money do you have on you?
How often do you brush your teeth?
How often do you check your email?
How will Tom get out of that mess?
Human beings are social creatures 
Hurry up! The concert is starting 
Hurry up, or we'll miss the train 
I accidentally deleted everything 
I admit that I was a little drunk 
I almost didn't do that yesterday 
I almost forgot to do my homework 
I almost never get what I ask for 
I always knew this day would come 
I am ashamed of my son's laziness 
I am complaining to the principal 
I am determined to be a scientist 
I am fed up with his vulgar jokes 
I am fed up with this wet weather 
I am glad that you have succeeded 
I am happy that you are my friend 
I am looking forward to Christmas 
I am no more excited than you are 
I am not about to pay ten dollars 
I am not going anywhere on Sunday 
I am not what I was ten years ago 
I am pleased to help you if I can 
I am putting on weight these days 
I am ready to do anything for you 
I am responsible for this failure 
I am studying Chinese and Spanish 
I am sure I saw her two years ago 
I am sure of his passing the exam 
I am sure we have a lot in common 
I am who I am thanks to my mother 
I applied for a summer internship 
I arrived here about five o'clock 
I asked Tom how his job was going 
I asked Tom if he wanted to drive 
I asked Tom what he wanted to eat 
I asked Tom where he wanted to go 
I asked him to lend me some money 
I asked myself that same question 
I asked the doctor some questions 
I asked you not to play with that 
I assume you still live in Boston 
I assume you're talking about Tom 
I assure you that isn't necessary 
I avoid going there late at night 
I believe I can help you find Tom 
I believe it is a genuine Picasso 
I believe they're a perfect match 
I bought a car in Derry yesterday 
I bought a smartphone for my wife 
I bought it at a department store 
I bought the book for ten dollars 
I broke his heart, but I love him 
I broke my arm when I was a child 
I burned my fingers on a hot iron 
I called him a coward to his face 
I came here to give you something 
I came here to tell you something 
I came here to warn you about Tom 
I can barely sleep at all anymore 
I can both speak and write French 
I can get you everything you need 
I can meet you at the bus station 
I can see Tom wasn't exaggerating 
I can see the top of the mountain 
I can't bear the noise any longer 
I can't believe I listened to you 
I can't believe Tom remembered me 
I can't believe Tom still uses it 
I can't buy a book this expensive 
I can't decide where to eat lunch 
I can't decide which house to buy 
I can't drive Tom to school today 
I can't even remember my own name 
I can't find what I'm looking for 
I can't give you the answer today 
I can't hear a word Tom is saying 
I can't imagine a day without you 
I can't let you go in there alone 
I can't lift this  It's too heavy 
I can't make a decision on my own 
I can't make that kind of promise 
I can't predict what might happen 
I can't promise Tom won't be back 
I can't put up with it any longer 
I can't put up with these insults 
I can't raise our child by myself 
I can't remember how long it took 
I can't remember who I gave it to 
I can't say anything at this time 
I can't see who Tom is talking to 
I can't seem to do anything right 
I can't sleep with all this noise 
I can't talk about that right now 
I can't talk about this right now 
I can't talk you out of it, can I?
I can't tell you what Tom told me 
I can't think of life without you 
I cannot trust a person like that 
I captured butterflies with a net 
I constantly quarrel with my wife 
I convinced him that he was wrong 
I could get you arrested for that 
I could hardly close the suitcase 
I could hardly keep from laughing 
I could have sworn I saw somebody 
I could never go back there again 
I could recite the story by heart 
I could use a little help in here 
I could've met you at the airport 
I couldn't agree with his opinion 
I couldn't find a taxi last night 
I couldn't make myself understood 
I couldn't recognize her at first 
I cry every time I hear this song 
I cut myself shaving this morning 
I decided to study all night long 
I definitely want to do that soon 
I did nothing during the holidays 
I did nothing out of the ordinary 
I did that while Tom was sleeping 
I didn't ask you for your opinion 
I didn't expect you to come today 
I didn't feel like talking to Tom 
I didn't find everything I needed 
I didn't finish reading that book 
I didn't go to school last Monday 
I didn't intend to argue with Tom 
I didn't know Tom lived in Boston 
I didn't know Tom was Mary's boss 
I didn't know Tom was coming back 
I didn't know exactly what to say 
I didn't know he had a weak heart 
I didn't know that dogs swim well 
I didn't know tofu was this tasty 
I didn't know you cared that much 
I didn't know you had a boyfriend 
I didn't know you played the oboe 
I didn't like what he said at all 
I didn't manage to see who it was 
I didn't mean to step on any toes 
I didn't need any help doing that 
I didn't need to pay for the food 
I didn't read any books yesterday 
I didn't realize how hungry I was 
I didn't realize what I was doing 
I didn't realize what time it was 
I didn't see Tom at all yesterday 
I didn't see him again after that 
I didn't send any pictures to Tom 
I didn't tell Tom that I knew you 
I didn't think Tom was suspicious 
I didn't think this was your seat 
I didn't understand what you said 
I didn't understand your question 
I dipped my finger into the honey 
I disagree with you on the matter 
I do not doubt that he is sincere 
I don't believe Tom is the killer 
I don't believe anything Tom says 
I don't believe such things exist 
I don't care for the way he talks 
I don't care what you think of me 
I don't even know Tom's last name 
I don't even know where Tom lives 
I don't feel like speaking German 
I don't feel like watching TV now 
I don't get enough sleep at night 
I don't go to school on Saturdays 
I don't hang out with Tom anymore 
I don't have a lot of money on me 
I don't have any Canadian friends 
I don't have any feelings for Tom 
I don't have anybody to play with 
I don't have anything to give you 
I don't have the money to do that 
I don't have time to take a break 
I don't have to worry about money 
I don't know any more than you do 
I don't know anybody by that name 
I don't know anybody in this town 
I don't know anyone who likes Tom 
I don't know anything about Japan 
I don't know her telephone number 
I don't know how deep the lake is 
I don't know how to change a tire 
I don't know how you can eat that 
I don't know if I should tell Tom 
I don't know if I should tell him 
I don't know many words in Hebrew 
I don't know much about Australia 
I don't know much about computers 
I don't know what Tom did with it 
I don't know what Tom is plotting 
I don't know what happened to Tom 
I don't know what happened to him 
I don't know what happened to you 
I don't know what that means, Tom 
I don't know what this is made of 
I don't know what this word means 
I don't know what to do about Tom 
I don't know what to do right now 
I don't know what to do with this 
I don't know what to make of this 
I don't know what your problem is 
I don't know what's going on here 
I don't know when he'll come back 
I don't know when he'll come here 
I don't know when she got married 
I don't know where Tom is staying 
I don't know where that came from 
I don't know where this came from 
I don't know which button to push 
I don't know who to trust anymore 
I don't know who you want to meet 
I don't know why Tom got so angry 
I don't know why Tom is mad at me 
I don't know why Tom's doing that 
I don't like Tom and I never will 
I don't like any of these records 
I don't like people looking at me 
I don't like people staring at me 
I don't like talking about myself 
I don't like to talk about myself 
I don't like your going out alone 
I don't need to go anywhere today 
I don't own any expensive jewelry 
I don't plan to do that by myself 
I don't put syrup on French toast 
I don't really know Tom very well 
I don't remember agreeing to that 
I don't remember her name anymore 
I don't remember seeing it before 
I don't remember who gave me this 
I don't see that there's a choice 
I don't study as much as Tom does 
I don't swim as much as I used to 
I don't teach French here anymore 
I don't think I can do this alone 
I don't think I'll pass this exam 
I don't think he killed those men 
I don't think he knows I love you 
I don't think it'll rain tomorrow 
I don't think it's anyone's fault 
I don't think that Tom was afraid 
I don't think that Tom was hiding 
I don't think we have enough time 
I don't think we'll see Tom again 
I don't think we've got much time 
I don't think you should eat that 
I don't think you're being honest 
I don't understand how this works 
I don't understand your reasoning 
I don't want to disappoint my dad 
I don't want to do anything risky 
I don't want to give up right now 
I don't want to go shopping today 
I don't want to go to the dentist 
I don't want to hear another word 
I don't want to hear any backtalk 
I don't want to hear your excuses 
I don't want to hurt his feelings 
I don't want to live here anymore 
I don't want to see anybody today 
I don't want to talk about it now 
I don't want to talk about school 
I don't want to tell Tom anything 
I don't want to think about death 
I don't want to try anything else 
I don't want to work here anymore 
I doubt Tom would be that foolish 
I doubt that's just a coincidence 
I dreamed about you the other day 
I drove to town and went shopping 
I erased my hard disk by accident 
I expect Tom will know what to do 
I expect you to tell me the truth 
I explained the procedures to him 
I feel comfortable in her company 
I feel comfortable in his company 
I feel so happy when I'm with you 
I fell asleep with my contacts in 
I felt an impulse to cry out loud 
I felt better after I took a rest 
I felt my heart beating violently 
I felt that my honor was at stake 
I finally found out what happened 
I finally was able to contact Tom 
I forgot to pay the electric bill 
I forgot to tell you where I live 
I found Tom's secret hiding place 
I found a good Mexican restaurant 
I found it hard to close the door 
I found out what's wrong with Tom 
I found the bed quite comfortable 
I found the lost ball in the park 
I found the problem uncomplicated 
I found this restaurant by chance 
I found this watch at the station

I got to the station this morning 
I graduated from Kyoto University 
I guess I never noticed it before 
I guess I'll find out soon enough 
I guess Tom is looking after Mary 
I guess it depends on the weather 
I had a cup of coffee at the cafe 
I had a horrible dream last night 
I had a little fever this morning 
I had a terrible dream last night 
I had expected him at the meeting 
I had hoped that he would recover 
I had my hair cut at the barber's 
I had my wallet stolen on the bus 
I had never been so scared before 
I had no idea what I should write 
I had nothing in common with them 
I had some money stolen yesterday 
I had the same problem as you did 
I had to compromise on this point 
I had to run to catch up with Tom

I have more books than I can read 
I have never eaten a mango before 
I have never seen anyone like him 
I have no idea of what it is like 
I have no idea what this is about 
I have no idea who that is either 
I have no idea why Tom isn't here 
I have no intention of asking him 
I have no memory of what happened 
I have no more money in my wallet 
I have no one to blame but myself 
I have no one to go to for advice 
I have no reason not to trust Tom 
I have not finished breakfast yet 
I have nothing in common with her 
I have nothing in common with him 
I have nothing to open a can with 
I have only two classes this year 
I have problems with my wife, too 
I have recovered from my bad cold 
I have seen nobody apart from you

I haven't seen you in here before 
I haven't seen you in three years 
I haven't spoken French for years 
I haven't talked to anyone lately 
I haven't thought about it at all 
I haven't unpacked my clothes yet 
I hear a dog barking in the woods 
I hear you're moving to Australia 
I heard Tom singing in the shower 
I heard it from a reliable source 
I heard our dog barking all night 
I heard someone screaming my name 
I heard you say that this morning 
I helped my mother in the kitchen 
I hope I can see you at Christmas 
I hope I won't get fired for this 
I hope Tom is having a lot of fun 
I hope the weather stays this way 
I hope to see my parents tomorrow 
I hope to see you again next year 
I hope we didn't keep you waiting 
I hope we meet again someday soon 
I hope you don't change your mind 
I hope you have a speedy recovery 
I hope you'll come again some day 
I hope you're enjoying yourselves 
I insist that you leave Tom alone 
I intend to stay there for a week 
I introduced her to you last week 
I invited her to go to the movies 
I just bought a new pair of shoes 
I just did what you told me to do 
I just don't get modern sculpture 
I just don't want Tom to get hurt 
I just followed your instructions 
I just graduated from high school 
I just had to see this for myself 
I just have a couple of questions 
I just have to drop this book off 
I just made a fresh pot of coffee 
I just need to know what happened 
I just thought I'd call and check 
I just want to be a normal person 
I just want to be alone right now 
I just want to know what happened 
I just want to live a normal life 
I just wanted to get it over with 
I killed two birds with one stone 
I knew Tom wasn't going to change 
I knew you were going to ask that 
I knew you were hiding in the car 
I know I shouldn't have done that 
I know Tom is thinking about that 
I know exactly what Tom was doing 
I know how many of them there are 
I know how to take care of myself 
I know it was wrong to lie to you 
I know neither of the two sisters 
I know something Tom doesn't know 
I know that I'm not a likable guy 
I know that Tom did it on purpose 
I know that Tom doesn't like Mary 
I know that Tom is a very shy boy 
I know that Tom is very talkative 
I know that you did it on purpose 
I know that's not why you're here 
I know the man sitting over there 
I know this has been hard for you 
I know this isn't what you wanted 
I know what it's like to be alone 
I know what you're planning to do 
I know you forged Tom's signature 
I know you have a house in Hawaii 
I know you have an essay to write 
I left Tom a message this morning 
I left three questions unanswered 
I lent Tom a book about Australia 
I like learning ancient languages 
I like oranges better than apples 
I like red wine better than white 
I like the new South African flag 
I like the way this flower smells 
I like this coat  May I try it on?
I like to get things done on time 
I like to learn ancient languages 
I like to read before I go to bed 
I like to study foreign languages 
I listen to the radio every night 
I listened to some CDs last night 
I look forward to your next visit 
I love you more and more each day 
I love you more than he loves you 
I made a lot of money on the side 
I made up my mind to study harder 
I meet her at school now and then 
I met her on a certain winter day 
I met him on the street by chance 
I met him then for the first time 
I might have left it on the table 
I moved to Boston three weeks ago 
I moved to Boston three years ago 
I moved to a new office this week 
I must remind you of your promise 
I must work hard to pass the test 
I must've parked my car elsewhere 
I nearly got hit by a truck today 
I need some help with my homework 
I need to be alone so I can think 
I need to find a new hiding place 
I need to get to this meeting now 
I need to put the children to bed 
I need to stop thinking about Tom 
I need to talk with you about Tom 
I need you to do something for me 
I never expected to see you again 
I never heard from Tom after that 
I never should've listened to you 
I never thought I'd see him there 
I never thought I'd see you again 
I never want to talk to you again 
I never wanted all this to happen 
I noticed him sneak into the room 
I object to her going there alone 
I often catch colds in the winter 
I often went skiing in the winter 
I only did that to make Tom angry 
I only drink decaffeinated coffee 
I only have one more favor to ask 
I only look like Tom  I'm not Tom 
I owe what I am today to my uncle 
I plan to go to Boston next month 
I planted a peach tree in my yard 
I play tennis all the year around 
I prefer being poor to being rich 
I prefer working to doing nothing 
I pressed my forehead against his 
I probably won't watch TV tonight 
I promise you I'll look after you 
I promised Tom I'd look after you 
I promised her not to do it again 
I put your suitcases in your room 
I ran in order to make it on time 
I reached the village before dark 
I really appreciate all your help 
I really appreciate your kindness 
I really do miss my parents a lot 
I really don't know Tom that well 
I really hope that doesn't happen 
I really liked watching you dance 
I really should be getting to bed 
I received your message yesterday 
I refuse to be ignored any longer 
I regard crab as a great delicacy 
I regret having done such a thing 
I remember Tom asking for my help 
I remember everything you tell me 
I remember hearing the story once 
I remember that I closed the door 
I said that quite a long time ago 
I sat down and opened my notebook 
I saw Tom and Mary leave together 
I saw Tom and his dog in the park 
I saw Tom getting into Mary's car 
I saw Tom running down the street 
I saw a cat running after the dog 
I saw a dog swim across the river 
I saw a horse galloping toward me 
I saw a man knocked down by a car 
I saw a stranger enter that house 
I saw a white bird on my way home 
I saw her somewhere two years ago 
I saw my reflection in the window 
I saw something white in the park 
I saw them over there a while ago 
I say this from my own experience 
I screamed at the top of my lungs 
I see someone waving a white flag 
I sharpened a pencil with a knife 
I should have done this weeks ago 
I should have done this years ago 
I should've apologized right away 
I should've followed Tom's advice 
I should've given you this sooner 
I should've invited Tom to dinner 
I should've known you'd come back 
I should've listened to my father 
I should've listened to my mother 
I should've put on some sunscreen 
I shouldn't have reacted that way 
I shoved my hands into my pockets 
I showed Tom how to tie a bowline 
I sit next to Tom in French class 
I smell something burning, Mother 
I sold the picture for 20,000 yen 
I spend money as soon as I get it 
I spent the whole day in the park 
I spent twelve hours on the train 
I spoke to Tom just the other day 
I spoke with him about the matter 
I spread the big map on the table 
I stayed in Boston for three days 
I still can't believe it happened 
I still don't know how to do this 
I still don't trust Tom very much 
I still have some pain in my knee 
I still haven't apologized to Tom 
I still wonder why Tom didn't win 
I study English an hour every day 
I study about two hours every day 
I think I can handle it from here 
I think I remember how to do that 
I think I'll walk to school today 
I think Tom did the best he could 
I think Tom didn't understand you 
I think Tom is afraid of your dog 
I think Tom is the one who'll win 
I think Tom knows what he's doing 
I think Tom looks a lot like John 
I think Tom was born in Australia 
I think Tom went to Boston by car 
I think Tom would have liked that 
I think he takes after his father 
I think he's Mary's older brother 
I think it was a misunderstanding 
I think it'll be raining tomorrow 
I think it'll rain this afternoon 
I think it's better not to try it 
I think it's time for us to leave 
I think my French isn't very good 
I think my German isn't very good 
I think that there is a man there 
I think that we're going to be OK 
I think there's someone out there 
I think we both know why I'm here 
I think we should call the police 
I think we should just be friends 
I think we should leave Tom alone 
I think we should lower the price 
I think we'll make it if we hurry 
I think you and he wanna be alone 
I think you know why I called you 
I think you'd better go on a diet 
I think you're on the right track 
I think you're sitting in my seat 
I think you're too drunk to drive 
I think you've been here too long 
I think you've made a big mistake 
I thought I could be of some help 
I thought I told you to go to bed 
I thought I'd never see you again 
I thought Tom had a place to live 
I thought Tom had stopped smoking 
I thought Tom wanted to marry you 
I thought Tom was meeting us here 
I thought Tom would agree with me 
I thought about you the other day 
I thought it might be complicated 
I thought it was common knowledge 
I thought it would be a good idea 
I thought it would make him laugh 
I thought it would make you laugh 
I thought that would interest you 
I thought that's why Tom was here 
I thought the food was too greasy 
I thought we had an understanding 
I thought you said Tom was a jerk 
I thought you said Tom was stupid 
I thought you said you were alone 
I thought you two knew each other 
I thought you wanted to marry Tom 
I thought you were already in bed 
I thought you were my best friend 
I thought you were off duty today 
I thought you would recognize Tom 
I threw the paper into the flames 
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here 
I told Tom how proud I was of him 
I told Tom that I didn't like him 
I told you I don't want your help 
I told you I'd think of something 
I told you not to call me at work 
I told you we had a lot in common 
I took a sleeping pill last night 
I took the liberty of calling her 
I tried to hide my disappointment 
I tried writing with my left hand 
I try to visit Tom whenever I can 
I used to be Tom's French teacher 
I used to feed my dog twice a day 
I used to go to church on Sundays 
I usually get home by six o'clock 
I usually get up at eight o'clock 
I usually go to school by bicycle 
I usually have breakfast at seven 
I visited Romania a few years ago 
I visited my friend Tom yesterday 
I walked the length of the street 
I want a massage  I need to relax 
I want a tie to go with this suit 
I want to avoid unnecessary risks 
I want to be able to speak French 
I want to be treated with respect 
I want to become a French teacher 
I want to become a better teacher 
I want to buy a pair of ski boots 
I want to give my old desk to Tom 
I want to go play with my friends 
I want to hear you play the piano 
I want to know what's in this box 
I want to know where you're going 
I want to know why Tom isn't here 
I want to know why you lied to me 
I want to learn Chinese next year 
I want to set the record straight 
I want to spend my life with Mary 
I want to tell you one thing more 
I want to travel around the world 
I want you to go to Osaka at once 
I want you to help me clean it up 
I want you to listen to this song 
I want you to look out the window 
I want you to meet my friend, Tom 
I want you to return to your seat 
I want you to wear your new dress 
I wanted to go to Boston with Tom 
I wanted to make Tom feel at home 
I wanted to punch him in the face 
I wanted to see what would happen 
I was a teacher for fifteen years 
I was able to answer the question 
I was able to win the first prize 
I was about to say the same thing 
I was affected by the summer heat 
I was already married at your age 
I was beginning to have my doubts 
I was born the year the war ended 
I was chained to the desk all day 
I was disappointed at the results 
I was extremely naive at the time 
I was happy that she took my side 
I was hoping you'd find something 
I was impressed with Tom's French 
I was in Australia all last month 
I was in Boston almost all summer 
I was in danger of losing my life 
I was just in time for the flight 
I was just looking out the window 
I was late because of the traffic 
I was looking for the right words 
I was moved to tears by the story 
I was present at school yesterday 
I was really young when I met you 
I was stupid enough to believe it 
I was surprised, to say the least 
I was taken up to the third floor 
I was talking about it last night 
I was ten minutes late for school 
I was the first to begin speaking 
I was tired, but I couldn't sleep 
I was too ashamed to say anything 
I was very happy to hear the news 
I was very impressed by his story 
I was waiting for you to say that 
I watch television in the evening 
I watched a great movie yesterday 
I went for a drive in the country 
I went for a walk to get some air 
I went to sleep during the lesson 
I went up to my bedroom on tiptoe 
I will abolish capital punishment 
I will be back in two week's time 
I will be free tomorrow afternoon 
I will finish my homework by nine 
I will follow you wherever you go 
I will give her the book tomorrow 
I will give him the book tomorrow 
I will give you anything you want 
I will give you whatever you want 
I will go provided that she comes 
I will have him repair this watch 
I will leave it to your judgement 
I will live in Sasayama next year 
I will not live in Kobe next year 
I will play tennis this afternoon 
I will tell the woman what I know 
I will tell you the rest tomorrow 
I wish I could have gone with her 
I wish I could run as fast as Tom 
I wish I were as smart as you are 
I wish Tom was here with me today 
I wish Tom was here with us today 
I wish Tom would smile more often 
I wish it would happen more often 
I wish my father had lived longer 
I wish that you were here with me 
I wish we could do this every day 
I wish you had let Tom go with us 
I wish you weren't always so busy 
I wish you would stop doubting me 
I wish you wouldn't smoke so much 
I won't be leaving until tomorrow 
I won't bore you with the details 
I won't let anyone push me around 
I won't lower myself to his level 
I won't take up much of your time 
I wonder if I hurt Tom's feelings 
I wonder if I'll ever get married 
I wonder if Tom is as old as Mary 
I wonder if it will rain tomorrow 
I wonder if the weather will hold 
I wonder what they have in common 
I wonder where Tom parked the car 
I wonder where Tom studied French 
I wonder whether Tom will help us 
I wonder whose scissors these are 
I wonder whose these scissors are 
I wonder why Tom is staring at me 
I would be very sad if I lost you 
I would like some hot tea, please 
I would like to ask two questions 
I would like to hear your opinion 
I would like to improve my French 
I would like to make a phone call 
I would like to move to Australia 
I would like to try this dress on 
I would love a cold glass of beer 
I would never want this to change 
I would prefer an honorable death 
I would rather die than marry him 
I would rather die than surrender 
I wouldn't go there if I were you 
I wouldn't sell that at any price 
I wouldn't want to live in Boston 
I write to my mother once a month 
I wrote more today than yesterday 
I'd have come if you'd invited me 
I'd like bread and butter, please 
I'd like to ask Tom what he means 
I'd like to cancel my reservation 
I'd like to change my reservation 
I'd like to discuss this with Tom 
I'd like to go somewhere else now 
I'd like to have a glass of water 
I'd like to have cake for dessert 
I'd like to have this fabric dyed 
I'd like to know what I did wrong 
I'd like to look at the wine list 
I'd like to play a game of squash 
I'd like to reserve a single room 
I'd like to sail around the world 
I'd like to see someone do better 
I'd like to sleep a little longer 
I'd like to speak French fluently 
I'd like to speak to Tom if I may 
I'd like to volunteer my services 
I'd like to work at the cafeteria 
I'd like you to look after my dog 
I'd like you to look at something 
I'd like you to wait in the lobby 
I'd love to know what's happening 
I'd never have done that that way 
I'd never marry someone like that 
I'd never played that game before 
I'd rather go today than tomorrow 
I'd rather live in a wooden house 
I'd rather not ask Tom to do that 
I'd rather ride my bike than walk 
I'll accompany you to the station 
I'll be able to do that on my own 
I'll be able to see you next year 
I'll be back in a couple of hours 
I'll be free three hours from now 
I'll be here from 2:30 until 6:30 
I'll be in Australia next weekend 
I'll be there in about 30 minutes 
I'll be with you in a few minutes 
I'll bet Tom will know what to do 
I'll call you in a couple of days 
I'll call you up tomorrow morning 
I'll certainly be sad if Tom dies 
I'll do anything you ask me to do 
I'll do that first thing tomorrow 
I'll follow Tom's recommendations 
I'll give you everything you need 
I'll go and get the book tomorrow 
I'll have to give it some thought 
I'll introduce you to a nice girl 
I'll invite whoever wants to come 
I'll let you know when it's ready 
I'll miss you very much if you go 
I'll never forget this experience 
I'll probably be doing that again 
I'll probably never do that again 
I'll see you again this afternoon 
I'll send the book to you by mail 
I'll take that into consideration 
I'll talk to Tom later about this 
I'll teach you how to drive a car 
I'll turn around while you change 
I'll wait here till he comes back 
I'm a big fan of American cooking 
I'm a member of the swimming club 
I'm accustomed to sitting up late 
I'm afraid I can't come on Monday 
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape 
I'm afraid that won't be possible 
I'm afraid that's not good enough 
I'm afraid we don't have any left 
I'm aware you've already finished 
I'm beginning to get used to this 
I'm beginning to lose my patience 
I'm better at French than English 
I'm busy looking for an apartment 
I'm calling from Tom's cell phone 
I'm excited about going to Boston 
I'm glad to see that you're happy 
I'm glad you talked me into going 
I'm going back home for Christmas 
I'm going back to Boston tomorrow 
I'm going to Tom's house to study 
I'm going to allow Tom to do that 
I'm going to buy a box of matches 
I'm going to go find the restroom 
I'm going to go for a little walk 
I'm going to join a demonstration 
I'm going to need some volunteers 
I'm going to play tennis tomorrow 
I'm going to report you to police 
I'm going to rest before I go out 
I'm going to stay at home tonight 
I'm going to take the 10:30 train 
I'm going to the dentist tomorrow 
I'm going to the library to study 
I'm going to the village tomorrow 
I'm grateful to you for your help 
I'm here because I need your help 
I'm here to fix the broken window 
I'm here to help in any way I can 
I'm just trying to understand you 
I'm learning to play the clarinet 
I'm looking for a bag for my wife 
I'm looking for one of my sisters 
I'm looking forward to seeing Tom 
I'm looking forward to seeing him 
I'm not as famous as I used to be 
I'm not as old as Tom thinks I am 
I'm not as rich as I'd like to be 
I'm not authorized to do anything 
I'm not doing this with you again 
I'm not going to Boston this year 
I'm not going to do that with Tom 
I'm not going to go unless you go 
I'm not going to put up with this 
I'm not going to take that chance 
I'm not happy with this situation 
I'm not impressed with Tom's work 
I'm not rich, but not poor either 
I'm not rich, nor do I wish to be 
I'm not sure I want to touch that 
I'm not sure if I'll go to Boston 
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive 
I'm not sure where to park my car 
I'm not sure who Tom's married to 
I'm not sure who Tom's teacher is 
I'm not taking the blame for that 
I'm not used to going to bed late 
I'm not used to this kind of cold 
I'm not used to working this hard 
I'm not very good with chopsticks 
I'm not willing to take that risk 
I'm often mistaken for my brother 
I'm pretty sure Tom can afford it 
I'm pretty sure Tom won't do that 
I'm proud to have Tom as a friend 
I'm proud to have you on our team 
I'm really bad at stuff like that 
I'm really too drunk for this now 
I'm really worried about my child 
I'm skimming his report right now 
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse 
I'm sorry I can't be of more help 
I'm sorry I forgot to wake you up 
I'm sorry I'm calling you at work 
I'm sorry for having deceived you 
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings 
I'm sorry that I can't come today 
I'm sorry, but I don't understand 
I'm sorry, but I'm busy right now 
I'm sorry, we don't accept checks 
I'm spending the evening with Tom 
I'm suffering from a bad headache 
I'm sure Tom will be here shortly 
I'm sure he'll pass the next exam 
I'm sure that I'll miss Tom a lot 
I'm sure you'll like your new job 
I'm surprised you weren't invited 
I'm taking pictures of the bridge 
I'm taking tomorrow afternoon off 
I'm talking to one of my students 
I'm the black sheep of the family 
I'm the luckiest man in the world 
I'm the one who taught Tom French 
I'm thinking about something else 
I'm tired and I want to go to bed 
I'm tired of picking up after you 
I'm trying to eat more vegetables 
I'm twice as busy as I was before 
I'm warning you for the last time 
I'm worried about Tom being alone 
I'm young, but I'm not that young 
I've already done that once today 
I've already finished my homework 
I've asked Tom to stop doing that 
I've been a teacher for two years 
I've been in Boston since October 
I've been looking for you all day 
I've been retired for three years 
I've been thinking of you all day 
I've been waiting all day for you 
I've been waiting for this moment 
I've been waiting for you all day 
I've been working here since 2013 
I've climbed Mt  Fuji three times 
I've come all the way from Boston 
I've cooked you a nice hot dinner 
I've decided to continue studying 
I've despised Tom for a long time 
I've done things I'm not proud of 
I've enjoyed this novel very much 
I've got a class in a few minutes 
I've got almost everything I need 
I've got nothing to say right now 
I've got to do something about it 
I've got to go to church tomorrow 
I've had no problems with my boss 
I've heard no complaints from Tom 
I've just been to the post office 
I've known Tom since I was little 
I've known Tom since we were kids 
I've known her since I was little 
I've learned a good deal from you 
I've made the same mistake myself 
I've managed to stop the bleeding 
I've never been more proud of you 
I've never been this happy before 
I've never felt better in my life 
I've never had a traffic accident 
I've never had to go there before 
I've never heard Tom speak French 
I've never mentioned it to anyone 
I've never played tennis with Tom 
I've never read a novel in French 
I've never seen Tom act like that 
I've never seen him wearing jeans 
I've never taught anyone anything 
I've never told a joke in my life 
I've never told anyone about this 
I've persuaded Tom not to do that 
I've read that book several times 
I've spent 500 dollars in one day 
I've started playing guitar again 
Iceland used to belong to Denmark 
If I were rich, I would go abroad 
If Tom does that, I'll eat my hat 
If Tom doesn't go, I won't either 
If anything can go wrong, it will 
If it rains, bring the washing in 
If only I'd hadn't stayed so long!
If something goes wrong, call Tom 
If that happens again, I'll leave 
If you can't beat them, join them 
If you don't want it, I'll eat it 
If you need anything, let me know 
If you'd listen, you'd understand 
Imagine yourself on a mountaintop 
In India, cows are sacred animals 
In Japan people drive on the left 
In any case, it's always my fault 
In case of a fire, use the stairs 
In case of an emergency, dial 110 
In my dream, I encountered a wolf 
In my opinion, we should hire Tom 
In spring, the days become longer 
In that case, I'll change my mind 
In the long run, prices will rise 
Is French pronunciation difficult?
Is Tom the one who took you there?
Is Tom too young to play baseball?
Is it all right if I call you Tom?
Is it too late for us to register?
Is it true that you came by plane?
Is now a good time to talk to Tom?
Is she still working as a teacher?
Is something wrong with your eyes?
Is that all you have to say to me?
Is that supposed to be a question?
Is that the map that Tom gave you?
Is the exhibit open to the public?
Is the hotel close to the airport?
Is the road all right to drive on?
Is there a cash machine near here?
Is there a restaurant around here?
Is there a youth hostel near here?
Is there another word for synonym?
Is there any place you want to go?
Is there anything else you'd like?
Is there anything new on the menu?
Is there enough food for everyone?
Is there space for another person?
Is this made out of wood or metal?
Is this really all that important?
Is this the right train for Tokyo?
Is this your first visit to Japan?
Is your new computer working well?
Is your school far from your home?
Isn't Tom supposed to be the boss?
Isn't talking about dreams boring?
Isn't that the Golden Gate Bridge?
Isn't that what you always wanted?
It appears that he was in a hurry 
It cost less than fifteen dollars 
It could just be your imagination 
It doesn't look very fun, does it?
It doesn't seem possible, does it?
It happened between eight and ten 
It has been raining since Tuesday 
It has never snowed on the island 
It has no bearing on this problem 
It is a great pleasure to be here 
It is a lot of fun to drive a car 
It is a very difficult job for us 
It is better for you to do it now 
It is better to ignore this point 
It is dangerous to drink too much 
It is easy to answer the question 
It is hard for me to believe this 
It is illegal to park a car there 
It is not a matter to laugh about 
It is not always cold in Hokkaido 
It is not far away from the hotel 
It is not good to laugh at others 
It is not worthwhile saving money 
It is of little consequence to me 
It is premature to discuss it now 
It is probable that she will come 
It is time you told her the truth 
It is too expensive for me to buy 
It is used by a great many people 
It is very hot here in the summer 
It is very kind of you to help me 
It isn't worth repairing this car 
It looks fun  Why don't we try it?
It looks like Tom decided to stay 
It looks like Tom is disappointed 
It looks like Tom is disorganized 
It looks like we fell into a trap

It seems like he knows the secret 
It seems that I'm not lucky today 
It seems that he is telling a lie 
It seems that he knows everything 
It seems that the diamond is real 
It seems that they have quarreled 
It takes three hours to get there 
It was a contemptible thing to do 
It was a waste of time and effort 
It was almost noon when I woke up 
It was almost too good to be true 
It was just a passing infatuation 
It was quite dark when I got home 
It was the worst night of my life 
It was very cold, but we went out 
It was very nice seeing you again 
It was where Tom said it would be 
It wasn't Tom's idea  It was mine 
It wasn't difficult to understand 
It wasn't exactly a piece of cake 
It wasn't supposed to be this way 
It will begin snowing before long 
It would be nice to see Tom again 
It would be sad if that were true 
It'll be finished in a day or two

It's almost impossible to imagine 
It's already ten o'clock at night 
It's always a pleasure to see you 
It's clearly Tom's responsibility 
It's doubtful whether Tom can win 
It's easy to answer your question 
It's eight o'clock in the morning 
It's hard to get people to change 
It's hard to understand his ideas 
It's kind of you to drive me home 
It's mean of you to talk that way 
It's more trouble than it's worth 
It's naive of you to believe that 
It's not blood  It's tomato sauce 
It's not difficult to learn Dutch 
It's not like Tom to get so angry 
It's now time for me to go to bed 
It's probably just my imagination 
It's prohibited in most countries 
It's raining, but we'll go anyway 
It's really difficult to describe 
It's starting to get dark outside 
It's still snowing pretty heavily 
It's strange that nobody knows us 
It's the best-kept secret in town 
It's the only possible conclusion 
It's time to get down to business 
It's too bad you've caught a cold 
It's too dark here to read a book 
It's too hot to wear a turtleneck 
It's warm here all the year round

Let's hope we did the right thing 
Let's leave that matter for later 
Let's make sure nothing is wasted 
Let's not wait for Tom any longer 
Let's pretend this never happened 
Let's pretend we didn't hear that 
Let's see if Tom is in his office 
Let's see what tonight will bring

Write down Tom's address for Mary 
Yesterday I had my bicycle stolen 
Yokohama is a beautiful port town 
You actually did that to yourself 
You already knew that, didn't you?
You are expected to do a good job 
You are expected to pass the exam 
You are expecting too much of her 
You are from Hokkaido, aren't you?
You are not able to swim, are you?
You are right to a certain extent 
You are too young to travel alone 
You aren't going to walk, are you?
You can come, too, if you want to 
You can see the sea on your right 
You can smell the ocean from here 
You can stay only if you're quiet 
You can still help Tom, can't you?
You can swim much better than him 
You can't always do what you want 
You can't force me to do anything 
You can't give orders around here 
You can't help now  It's too late 
You can't let Tom behave that way 
You can't say we didn't warn them 
You can't seem to finish anything 
You can't trust anyone these days 
You can't trust or believe anyone 
You can't wear that hat to school 
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
You do look a little better today 
You don't even know where you are 
You don't have to get up so early 
You don't have to go out with Tom 
You don't have to say you love me 
You don't have to stay to the end 
You don't have to work on Sundays 
You don't know who did it, do you?
You don't look like a millionaire 
You don't need to leave right now 
You don't need to worry about Tom 
You don't want to do that, do you?
You forgot to turn off the lights 
You had better not read this book 
You had better not sit up so late 
You hate psychiatrists, don't you?
You have a busy week ahead of you 
You have a lot to learn about men 
You have a strange sense of humor 
You have no choice in this matter 
You have nothing to be ashamed of 
You have only to touch the button 
You have reached your destination 
You have ten seconds left to live 
You have the right to an attorney 
You have the right to be creative 
You have thirty minutes to decide 
You have to accept the inevitable 
You just have to trust each other 
You know Tom is telling the truth 
You know what Tom said, don't you?
You look incredible in that dress 
You look nice in that red sweater 
You looked terrible the other day 
You may as well go to bed at once 
You may as well tell me the truth 
You may choose whichever you want 
You may have to pay a little more 
You might have left it in the car 
You must break the vicious circle 
You must do as you are told to do 
You must learn from your mistakes 
You must learn to be more careful 
You must not speak so loudly here 
You must steer clear of that gang 
You must think I'm really strange 
You need to ask Tom what he'll do 
You need to get in touch with Tom 
You need to get your eyes checked 
You never admitted you were wrong 
You ought not to say such a thing 
You ought to find nice shoes here 
You owe Tom three hundred dollars 
You put far too much pepper in it 
You remind me of how I used to be 
You said you could play the piano 
You said you wouldn't talk to Tom 
You should be proud of yourselves 
You should be ready for the worst 
You should get your eyes examined 
You should have gotten up earlier 
You should have refused his offer 
You should have stayed in the car 
You should have your eyes checked 
You should know that's impossible 
You should marry someone you love 
You should obey the traffic rules 
You should prepare for the future 
You should read between the lines 
You should return what you borrow 
You should've introduced yourself 
You shouldn't break your promises 
You shouldn't speak so ill of him 
You shouldn't talk back like that 
You sure look handsome today, Tom 
You told me you knew how to do it 
You two probably want to be alone 
You want to leave here, don't you?
You want to stay alive, don't you?
You were never in any real danger 
You were the one who suggested it 
You were told to stay on the ship 
You were very hungry, weren't you?
You will be sorry for it some day 
You won't believe what I just saw 
You won't get a chance to do that 
You won't get rid of me so easily 
You wouldn't have to say anything 
You'd better not stay up too late 
You'd better not talk back to Tom 
You'll have to do that yourselves 
You'll never guess who I just met 
You're a good deal older than Tom 
You're a really good photographer 
You're acting like a spoiled brat 
You're always welcome at my place 
You're blushing like a schoolgirl 
You're free to say what you think 
You're going to be a great father 
You're good at French, aren't you?
You're making that up, aren't you?
You're no longer a spring chicken 
You're not answering the question 
You're not going to understand it 
You're not going to walk, are you?
You're not supposed to be in here 
You're not the only Canadian here 
You're obviously dying to tell me 
You're really a good photographer 
You're taking this too personally 
You're the last hope for humanity 
You're the only one I think about 
You're very religious, aren't you?
You're wrong  That's not the case 
You've already told me this story 
You've been walking in your sleep 
You've drunk three cups of coffee 
You've gained weight, haven't you?
You've got nothing to worry about 
You've lost your job, haven't you?
You've made me look like an idiot 
You've outdone yourself this time 
You've put on weight, haven't you?
You've run out of things to drink 
Your French is hard to understand 
Your bike is much newer than mine 
Your birthday is the same as mine 
Your cell phone rang a minute ago 
Your driver's license has expired 
Your father is a very nice person 
Your fingerprints were on the gun 
Your friendship means a lot to me 
Your handwriting is quite elegant 
Your hat is somewhere around here 
Your mother would be proud of you 
Your parents must've been worried 
Your thirty minutes are almost up 
Your train leaves from Platform 3 
Are you Swedish?  No, I'm Swiss  
Are you hungry?  No, not really  
I saw her five days ago, he said 
Is Tom afraid?  Yes, I think so  
Leave me alone, she said angrily 
What day is today?  It's Monday  
What time is it now?  It's 3:30  
You're a murderer!  No, I'm not!

I asked Tom to confirm my findings 
I asked Tom to proofread my report 
I asked Tom where he wanted to eat 
I asked him if he knew her address 
I assume you are talking about Tom 
I assumed Tom was waiting for Mary 
I assure you I'm in perfect health 
I ate nothing but bread and butter 
I ate one and then I ate the other 
I believed that he was a physician

I bought that from a street vendor 
I bought the car at a 10% discount 
I brought some of my books to read

I can't tell you what my plans are 
I can't think about this right now 
I can't think of his name just now 
I can't understand why he did that 
I carried the heavy bag on my back 
I come from a long line of doctors 
I congratulated him on his success 
I could have sworn something moved 
I could not bring myself to eat it 
I could put in a good word for you 
I could stand to lose a few pounds 
I could swim well when I was a boy 
I could use a couple of days alone 
I couldn't get him to stop smoking

I did not expect it to be that big 
I did so for the sake of my health 
I didn't eat anything for six days 
I didn't expect Tom to do anything

I don't ever want to do this again 
I don't ever want to see Tom again 
I don't ever want to see you again

I don't remember inviting you here 
I don't remember my father anymore 
I don't remember sending that text 
I don't remember that conversation 
I don't remember where I bought it

I don't think I can wait that long 
I don't think I'd enjoy doing that 
I don't think I've broken any laws 
I don't think I've got much choice 
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend 
I don't think Tom has met Mary yet 
I don't think Tom sees it that way 
I don't think Tom understands that 
I don't think everyone is here yet 
I don't think it's a good decision 
I don't think she can speak French 
I don't think that'll be necessary 
I don't think that's even possible 
I don't trust anyone except myself 
I don't trust anyone, not even Tom

I eat Thai food every chance I get 
I eat dinner at quarter past seven 
I enjoy intellectual conversations 
I enjoy the time we spend together 
I entirely approve of what you say 
I exercise for two hours every day 
I expect Tom won't want to do that 
I expect him to come at any moment 
I feel like I've known Tom forever 
I feel like eating something sweet 
I feel like someone is watching me 
I feel like someone is watching us 
I fell asleep while reading a book 
I felt a sharp pain in the stomach 
I forgot how good you were at golf 
I forgot that I met her last month 
I forgot to ask Tom for his advice 
I forgot to tell you what Tom said 
I found a rare stamp at that store 
I found it difficult to please her 
I found it while I was cleaning up 
I found no money left in my pocket 
I found out where Tom used to live 
I found the key underneath the mat 
I gave Tom a chance to work for me 
I gave him what little money I had 
I gave them clothing and some food 
I get scared just walking past him 
I go to bed at around ten at night 
I go to church once in a blue moon

I go to the movies once in a while 
I got Tom to sign the new contract 
I got a call from Tom this morning 
I got a call from the school today 
I got to the bus stop just in time 
I guess I just got lucky this time

I have no idea how long it'll take 
I have no idea what I'm doing here 
I have no intention of getting wet

I have no time to engage in gossip 
I have nothing else to add to that 
I have nothing to do at the moment 
I have one brother and two sisters 
I have some things to take care of 
I have some wonderful news for you

I haven't had a reply to my letter 
I haven't heard that name in years 
I haven't seen him for a long time 
I haven't seen him since that time 
I haven't seen that in a long time 
I haven't seen you for a long time 
I haven't talked to Tom since then 
I haven't washed my hair in a week 
I haven't yet finished my homework 
I hear that she's a famous actress 
I hear you have friends in the CIA 
I hear you were in Boston recently 
I hear you've got a new girlfriend 
I heard Tom singing in the kitchen 
I heard a young girl call for help 
I heard my name called from behind

I hope you didn't misunderstand me 
I hope you enjoy your stay with us 
I hope you're not talking about me 
I intend to show Tom these letters 
I intend to study abroad next year 
I intended to visit Rome last year 
I just did what Tom asked me to do 
I just did what they told me to do 
I just did what you asked me to do 
I just didn't feel like getting up 
I just finished cleaning the attic 
I just need to blow off some steam 
I just needed a shoulder to cry on 
I just saw you guys three days ago 
I just want to get off this island 
I just want to know if you love me 
I knew both Tom and Mary very well 
I knew we should've stayed at home 
I know Tom can't understand French 
I know Tom does that every morning 
I know almost nothing about Boston 
I know exactly what you're feeling 
I know how much you care about Tom 
I know how to make beef stroganoff 
I know someone who lives in Boston 
I know that money isn't everything 
I know the boy standing over there 
I know the house where he was born 
I know this is difficult to accept 
I know what your first thought was 
I know where Tom left his umbrella 
I know where Tom went last weekend 
I laughed so much my stomach hurts 
I learned French instead of German 
I learned nothing from the teacher 
I left as soon as I had the chance 
I left my umbrella here last night 
I lent him what little money I had 
I let Tom borrow my baseball glove 
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me 
I like a lot of sugar in my coffee

I love you and I want to marry you 
I love you more and more every day 
I made Tom promise to come on time 
I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid 
I meant to thank you for your help 
I meet him on occasion at the club 
I met Tom on my way to the theater 
I met her by chance in the library 
I met her during my stay in Mexico 
I met her in the store by accident 
I met him the day before yesterday 
I might go see Tom on October 20th 
I must find out who is behind this 
I must get off at the next station 
I must have expressed myself badly 
I must live up to his expectations 
I must remember to mail the letter 
I need a bag  Will you lend me one?
I need a hammer to nail the boards 
I need a shirt with a stiff collar 
I need some sugar  Do you have any?
I need some time to think about it 
I need three copies of this letter 
I need to ask you a silly question 
I need to be on my own for a while 
I need to find a higher paying job 
I need to leave before Tom arrives 
I never actually wanted to do that 
I never had the courage to open it 
I never meant to get your hopes up 
I never play the saxophone anymore 
I never should've brought you here 
I never want to see that guy again 
I no longer want to live in Boston 
I now know why Tom did what he did 
I object to my son studying abroad 
I often go for a swim in the river 
I only drank three bottles of beer 
I only saw one person on the beach 
I opened the box and looked inside 
I opened the can, but it was empty 
I ordered those books from Germany 
I owe my success to her assistance 
I owe what I am today to education 
I paid 300 dollars for this guitar 
I passed the information on to him 
I persuaded him to take part in it 
I play tennis fairly well, I think 
I play the guitar in my spare time 
I played tennis with Tom yesterday 
I prefer silver rings to gold ones 
I pretended that I didn't know Tom 
I promise I'll be there in an hour 
I promise that you won't regret it 
I promise you I'll never leave you 
I promised Tom I'd not tell anyone 
I promised Tom that I wouldn't cry 
I put on a little weight last year 
I raised my hand to ask a question 
I really don't think I can do that 
I really want to be a good teacher 
I really want to come to Australia 
I really wish you wouldn't do that 
I received a letter from my friend 
I received a letter from my sister 
I reckon it's time for us to leave 
I remember seeing the movie before 
I said some things I wish I didn't 
I sat down on the sofa next to Tom 
I saw Tom entering that restaurant 
I saw Tom in the library yesterday 
I saw a strange light in the woods 
I saw many birds yesterday morning 
I saw my sister tear up the letter 
I saw something strange in the sky 
I seem to have misplaced my wallet 
I sent you the money you asked for 
I should try to get Tom to do that 
I should've paid my rent yesterday 
I shouldn't have told you anything 
I sincerely hope for his happiness 
I sleep six hours a day on average 
I speak French as well as she does 
I spent all day thinking about Tom 
I spent last Sunday reading novels 
I stayed in Boston for three years 
I stayed indoors because it rained 
I still have a lot of time for fun 
I still have to pay the phone bill 
I still need to finish my homework 
I still remember that very clearly 
I still want to hear Tom's opinion 
I stopped smoking once and for all 
I studied English when I was there 
I studied hard to enter the school 
I suggest that we go out on Friday 
I suggest you have a talk with Tom 
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised 
I sure hope I don't catch anything 
I swear I'll never do such a thing 
I take the subway almost every day 
I take the train to work every day 
I talked to Tom just the other day 
I thanked him for the nice present 
I think I have a theory about that 
I think I saw a ghost in the woods 
I think I should've studied harder 
I think I'd like to be your friend 
I think I'll wear this red sweater 
I think Tom and Mary aren't biased 
I think Tom did that intentionally 
I think Tom knows where Mary lives 
I think Tom wants something to eat 
I think he wants you to notice him 
I think it's somewhere around here 
I think it's the smart thing to do 
I think that's exactly what I'd do 
I think the rain's getting heavier 
I think they were talking about me 
I think this book is worth reading 
I think we have to be very careful 
I think we have to make a decision 
I think we just have to be patient 
I think we should change the topic 
I think we should reduce the price 
I think what Tom said is incorrect 
I think you did that intentionally 
I think you owe her an explanation 
I think you should go out with Tom 
I think you will be a great father 
I think you're underestimating Tom 
I think you've hurt Tom's feelings 
I think your basic theory is wrong 
I think your hypothesis is correct 
I thought I knew him, but I didn't 
I thought Tom and Mary were hungry 
I thought Tom had gotten over Mary 
I thought Tom wanted to marry Mary 
I thought Tom was Mary's boyfriend 
I thought Tom was a complete idiot 
I thought Tom was going to do that 
I thought Tom was your best friend 
I thought Tom would be in his room 
I thought doing this would be easy 
I thought his opinion was relevant 
I thought that was kind of strange 
I thought that you'd recognize Tom 
I thought the enemy had killed Tom 
I thought you had come on business 
I thought you said you had to work 
I thought you said you worked here 
I thought you were going to Boston 
I thought you were living with Tom 
I thought you'd decided against it 
I thought you'd jump at the chance 
I thought you'd stopped dating Tom 
I told Tom he shouldn't drink that 
I told Tom that I would do my best 
I told Tom that you'd want to know 
I told Tom why I wanted to do that 
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go 
I told you to stop calling me that 
I took a taxi to get there in time 
I tried not to cry in front of him 
I tried to convince Tom to help us 
I tried to listen to him carefully 
I tried to persuade Tom to do that 
I tried to write with my left hand 
I used margarine instead of butter 
I usually come here in the morning 
I usually eat rice with chopsticks 
I visit my grandparents on Sundays 
I walked to the door and opened it 
I want brown shoes, not black ones 
I want those back when you're done 
I want to apologize for last night 
I want to apologize for what I did 
I want to be a nature photographer 
I want to get off at the next stop 
I want to go to Hawaii next spring 
I want to hear what Tom has to say 
I want to know how he planned this 
I want to know more about you, Tom 
I want to know what this is called 
I want to learn to play the guitar 
I want to leave this place quickly 
I want to meet people and have fun 
I want to see my friends in Canada 
I want to show you something great 
I want to thank you for helping me 
I want you home in time for dinner 
I want you to love me for who I am 
I want you to promise me something 
I want you to remember this moment 
I want you to see what you've done 
I wanted to know what would happen 
I wanted to make a few phone calls 
I wanted to retire three years ago 
I was asked to leave the classroom 
I was born and brought up in Tokyo 
I was convinced that he was guilty 
I was disappointed with his speech 
I was disappointed with the result 
I was disappointed with your paper 
I was fortunate to find a good job 
I was glad to hear of your success 
I was having trouble concentrating 
I was in Australia for a few weeks 
I was in London most of the summer 
I was only three years old in 2013 
I was really cute when I was a kid 
I was stupid enough to believe Tom 
I was surprised that he had failed 
I was tempted to lie, but I didn't 
I was the only one who didn't know 
I was thinking about what you said 
I was tired, but continued working 
I was treated like a child by them 
I was unable to finish my homework 
I was up all night working on that 
I was very chubby when I was a kid 
I was young and naive at that time 
I wasn't sure if Tom had eaten yet 
I wasn't sure if you'd come or not 
I went to Europe by way of America 
I went to Tom's house after school 
I went to primary school in Boston 
I went to see his sister last week 
I will be working all day tomorrow 
I will come to see you next Sunday 
I will give you the money tomorrow 
I will go cycling even if it rains 
I will go when they come back here 
I will teach you how to play chess 
I wish I could control my emotions 
I wish I had time for a girlfriend 
I wish Tom were my younger brother 
I wish he had attended the meeting 
I wish that Tom would just shut up 
I wish that she would stop smoking 
I wish you a lifetime of happiness 
I wish you would do as you're told 
I won't allow that to happen again 
I won't be at the opening ceremony 
I won't forgive what you did to me 
I won't get everything I asked for 
I won't go under any circumstances 
I won't go unless it stops raining 
I won't let anything happen to you 
I won't tell Tom what I want to do 
I wonder if Tom is still unmarried 
I wonder if Tom likes Chinese food 
I wonder if Tom still remembers me 
I wonder if something has happened 
I wonder if there's any connection 
I wonder what I'll find in the box 
I wonder what happened to Atlantis 
I wonder what's wrong with the car 
I wonder where that ship is headed 
I wonder which one of you is lying 
I wonder which way is the shortest 
I wonder why karaoke is so popular 
I wonder why you never got married 
I wondered why people stared at me 
I worked in Boston for three years 
I would like to ask a favor of you 
I would like to come to your party 
I would like to learn how to dance 
I would like to tell you something 
I would often play tennis with him 
I wouldn't be the same without you 
I wouldn't count on that happening 
I wouldn't have trusted Tom either 
I wouldn't like to be in her shoes 
I wrote a poem in memory of my dad 
I'd appreciate it if you'd help me 
I'd be very upset if that happened 
I'd forgotten how much I liked Tom 
I'd forgotten that you'd forgotten 
I'd like a cheeseburger and a coke 
I'd like to ask you some questions 
I'd like to get to know you better 
I'd like to have that gift wrapped 
I'd like to know Tom's whereabouts 
I'd like to know how Tom got there 
I'd like to know more about Boston 
I'd like to know what Tom is up to 
I'd like to know what you're doing 
I'd like to know why you were late 
I'd like to live in a decent house 
I'd like to open a savings account 
I'd like to put the past behind us 
I'd like to see you this afternoon 
I'd like to watch this movie again 
I'd like you to keep this a secret 
I'd love to hear you sing sometime 
I'd love to know how that happened 
I'd love to see inside Tom's house 
I'd rather go hungry than eat this 
I'd recognize Tom's voice anywhere 
I'll always remember your kindness 
I'll answer for this man's honesty 
I'll arrive on the 20th of October 
I'll ask Tom to buy tickets for us 
I'll be back as soon as I find Tom 
I'll be back in just a few minutes 
I'll be in my office all afternoon 
I'll be out of town for a few days 
I'll be seeing Mary this afternoon 
I'll be there by 2:30 without fail 
I'll be there in a couple of hours 
I'll be whatever you want me to be 
I'll burn the midnight oil tonight 
I'll call you when I get to Boston 
I'll check further into the matter 
I'll come over after I finish work 
I'll do whatever I can to help you 
I'll finish it as quickly as I can 
I'll give the room a good cleaning 
I'll give you a call before I come 
I'll go wherever you want me to go 
I'll keep it a secret  Don't worry 
I'll leave for Australia next week 
I'll let someone else deal with it 
I'll let you know when Tom arrives 
I'll never forget what you told me 
I'll never make that mistake again 
I'll never talk during class again 
I'll put Tom's courage to the test 
I'll see if Tom wants to come over 
I'll see this doesn't happen again 
I'll support you as long as I live 
I'll take any job you can offer me 
I'll tell you an interesting story 
I'll tell you what I know about it 
I'll tell you why I don't like Tom 
I'll wait here till Tom comes back 
I'll write to you when I get there 
I'm Irish, but I don't speak Irish 
I'm a little low on cash right now 
I'm afraid I can't talk about that 
I'm afraid I don't understand that 
I'm all alone in a foreign country 
I'm beginning to feel out of place 
I'm beginning to regret hiring Tom 
I'm beginning to see what you mean 
I'm being good to you this morning 
I'm especially pleased to meet you 
I'm glad that the rain has stopped 
I'm glad things worked out for you 
I'm glad you two are getting along 
I'm going to Australia in the fall 
I'm going to clock out early today 
I'm going to finish what I started 
I'm going to go say goodbye to Tom 
I'm going to go take a look around 
I'm going to leave one night early 
I'm going to read some other books 
I'm going to take good care of you 
I'm going to teach you some karate 
I'm going to the well to get water 
I'm going to turn in early tonight 
I'm happy to have you as a student 
I'm here to teach you some manners 
I'm interested in Japanese history 
I'm just saying it's a possibility 
I'm just trying to get to know you 
I'm looking for a gift for my wife 
I'm looking forward to next summer 
I'm lost  Could you please help me?
I'm much older than you think I am 
I'm never going to leave you again 
I'm not as healthy as I used to be 
I'm not falling for that one again 
I'm not familiar with that subject 
I'm not going to be afraid anymore 
I'm not going to explain it to you 
I'm not going to tell you her name 
I'm not good at classifying things 
I'm not good at this sort of thing 
I'm not interested in your excuses 
I'm not interested in your opinion 
I'm not mad  I'm just disappointed 
I'm not quite 150 centimeters tall 
I'm not saying I'm better than Tom 
I'm not sure if that's a good idea 
I'm not sure what's wrong with Tom 
I'm not sure when Tom will turn up 
I'm not sure who Tom is married to 
I'm not sure who wrote this report 
I'm not that much heavier than you 
I'm not the only one who likes Tom 
I'm not used to speaking in public 
I'm pretty sure Tom is dating Mary 
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat that 
I'm probably going to be busy soon 
I'm quite interested in philosophy 
I'm reading a book about languages 
I'm ready to admit it was my fault 
I'm really feeling kind of strange 
I'm really looking forward to this 
I'm really not supposed to do this 
I'm really scared of thunderstorms 
I'm scared Tom is going to kill me 
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting 
I'm sorry, but I can't go with you 
I'm sorry, but I couldn't avoid it 
I'm sorry, but I have no more time 
I'm sorry, my mother's not at home 
I'm struggling with French grammar 
I'm sure Tom would love to see you 
I'm sure everything will be OK now 
I'm sure you'll think of something 
I'm sure you're going to like this 
I'm surprised to hear you say that 
I'm the one who made that decision 
I'm thinking about going on a trip 
I'm thinking of opening up a store 
I'm tired of cleaning up after you 
I'm too busy to help you right now 
I'm too old for this sort of thing 
I'm trying to figure out something 
I'm trying to think of better plan 
I'm very busy so don't count on me 
I'm very sorry I came home so late 
I'm very surprised to see you here 
I'm very worried about your health 
I'm warning you not to do it again 
I've already discussed it with Tom 
I've already saved your life twice 
I've already told Tom all about it 
I've already told you what I think 
I've always played with my brother 
I've always wanted to study French 
I've become accustomed to the heat 
I've been an athlete my whole life 
I've been in business thirty years 
I've been listening the whole time 
I've been looking all over for Tom 
I've been looking all over for you 
I've been thinking about something 
I've been to Australia three times 
I've been waiting for half an hour 
I've been waiting for over an hour 
I've come up with a brilliant idea 
I've completely forgotten his name 
I've danced so much that I'm dizzy 
I've decided to become an engineer 
I've done business with Tom before 
I've finished watering the flowers 
I've got a lot of work to do today 
I've got a wife and three children 
I've got all the time in the world 
I've got to get dressed for school 
I've got two brothers and a sister 
I've just put new sheets on my bed 
I've known Tom for quite some time 
I've known Tom since I was a child 
I've learned a lot by watching Tom 
I've made a lot of stupid mistakes 
I've never done it this way before 
I've never had that problem before 
I've never had this problem before 
I've never heard that sound before 
I've never seen anything like this 
I've never seen such a large whale 
I've never told anyone that before 
I've never told anyone this before 
I've still got a lot of work to do 
I've told you that a hundred times 
I, too, didn't understand anything 
If I can understand it, anyone can 
If I do that, Tom will laugh at me 
If I don't do it now, I never will 
If I had a choice, I'd go home now 
If I had wings, I would fly to you 
If I were rich, I'd give you money 
If I'd only listened to my parents!
If Tom had more time, he'd do that 
If Tom said it, it's probably true 
If he tried hard, he would succeed 
If it were true, what would you do?
If that happens, I'll be very glad 
If you eat that, Tom will be angry 
If you ever need a job, go see Tom 
If you refuse, Tom will be furious 
If you understand, raise your hand 
If you want peace, prepare for war 
Imported cars are in strong demand 
In case I forget, please remind me 
In case of fire, break this window 
In case of fire, press this button 
In spite of the storm, he went out 
In the evening, I walk with my dog 
In the summer, eggs go bad quickly 
In the summer, it is very hot here 
In the war, many people died young 
Is Tom left-handed or right-handed?
Is Tom still determined to do that?
Is a tomato a fruit or a vegetable?
Is it certain that he will help us?
Is it true Tom can't read or write?
Is it true what they say about Tom?
Is that the book that Tom gave you?
Is there a book store in the hotel?
Is there a gas station around here?
Is there a photo shop in the hotel?
Is there a post office around here?
Is there a problem here, gentlemen?
Is there a service charge for that?
Is there a train station near here?
Is there any coffee in the kitchen?
Is there anyone who speaks English?
Is there anything I can do for you?
Is there some place I can lie down?
Is there someone who could help me?
Is there something I could get you?
Is there space for one more person?
Is this a good time to buy a house?
It almost sounds like you miss Tom 
It cost a lot more than I expected 
It depends on how you deal with it 
It happened completely by accident 
It happened to me about a year ago 
It is difficult to give up smoking 
It is easy to answer this question 
It is going to rain this afternoon 
It is important to help each other 
It is me that painted this picture 
It is said that she is a good cook 
It is true that he is over seventy 
It is true that the earth is round 
It is worthwhile to read this book 
It isn't as cold here as in Alaska 
It isn't difficult to speak French 
It isn't likely that she will come 
It isn't my fault that it happened 
It isn't polite to stare at people 
It looked like you were in a hurry 
It looks as if it is going to rain 
It looks like I came at a bad time 
It looks like I got here too early 
It looks like the TV isn't working 
It may already be too late for him 
It may be that he is not a bad man 
It must've rained during the night 
It seems that everybody likes golf 
It smells like something's rotting 
It snowed for ten consecutive days 
It sounds like you had a good time 
It took all night to climb Mt Fuji 
It was a great victory for Jackson 
It was a perfect day for a wedding 
It was a perfect day for the beach 
It was a pleasure meeting you, Tom 
It was a pleasure working with you 
It was a very traditional ceremony 
It was an unforgettable experience 
It was bitterly cold in Washington 
It was colder yesterday than today 
It was dark by the time I got home 
It was his bicycle that was stolen 
It was like a bolt out of the blue 
It was nothing less than a miracle 
It was quite dark when I got there 
It was really loud inside the club 
It was very cold yesterday morning 
It wasn't Tom who lit the campfire 
It worried me that she looked pale 
It would be crazy to do that again 
It'll be really lonely without you 
It'll cost you more to go by plane 
It'll make sense when you're older 
It'll probably rain this afternoon 
It's 300 miles from here to Boston 
It's a difficult country to govern 
It's a pity that you couldn't come 
It's a popular tourist destination 
It's a step in the right direction 
It's about time you went to school 
It's an hour's walk to the station 
It's been raining for about a week 
It's been raining since last night 
It's doubtful whether Tom will win 
It's funny you should mention that 
It's illegal to park your car here 
It's more dangerous than I thought 
It's more difficult than you think 
It's more fun than drinking coffee 
It's more than a hundred years old 
It's my dream to win a Nobel Prize 
It's no longer pitch black outside 
It's no use crying over spilt milk 
It's no use trying to convince Tom 
It's not difficult to speak French 
It's not easy being married to Tom 
It's not like you to cry at movies 
It's not likely to be hot tomorrow 
It's not much of a surprise, is it?
It's not polite to stare at others 
It's not worth reading any further 
It's obvious why his stomach hurts 
It's popular among senior citizens 
It's possible that Tom lied to you 
It's rude to talk during a concert 
It's said that he knows the secret 
It's so heavy that I can't lift it 
It's still too cold to wear shorts 
It's the only possible explanation 
It's the perfect moment for a kiss 
It's time for you to buy a new car 
It's time you went to the barber's 
It's your turn to tell me a secret 
JST stands for Japan Standard Time 
John met Mary on his way to school 
Just do what your mother tells you 
Just so you know, I'm an FBI agent 
Kyoto and Boston are sister cities 
Lack of food made them very hungry 
Last year, there was a bad harvest 
Leaf after leaf fell to the ground 
Learning English requires patience 
Learning a foreign language is fun 
Leave more space between the lines 
Leave some cake for the rest of us 
Let me introduce my parents to you 
Let me introduce you to my parents 
Let me know when you need me again 
Let me think about it a bit longer 
Let's begin with the first chapter 
Let's discuss the matter right now 
Let's discuss this at another time 
Let's eat now  I'm dying of hunger 
Let's find Highway 483 on this map 
Let's just try to have a good time 
Let's meet in front of the library 
Let's meet in front of the theater 
Let's not deviate from the subject 
Let's pick flowers from the garden 
Let's stop this fruitless argument 
Let's wait here till he comes back 
Life is often compared to a voyage 
Life without books is unimaginable 
Like his father, he has many books 
Look at me when I'm talking to you!
Look at me when I'm talking to you 
Look up the word in the dictionary 
Look! There's a cat in the kitchen 
Love began to grow between the two 
Luckily, Tom didn't break anything

Mary changed into her evening gown 
Mary has danced since she was five 
Mary is a professional pole dancer 
Mary is going to have another baby 
Mary is more attractive than Alice 
Mary is the prettiest woman I know 
Mary isn't as active as her sister 
Mary placed her purse on the table 
Mary pretended to polish her nails 
Mary really takes after her mother 
Mary thinks martial arts are silly 
Mary visited her husband in prison 
Mary was hardly a shrinking violet 
Mary was unaware of her own beauty 
Mary was wearing a tight red dress 
Mary wore a silver pin on her coat 
Mary's back pain was torturing her 
Mary's hair is blowing in the wind 
Mathematics is a difficult subject 
Mathematics is my favorite subject 
May I accompany you to the airport?
May I have a glass of milk, please?
May I have a glass of wine, please?
May I speak to Tom Jackson, please?
May I stay with you for a few days?
May I take a shower in the morning?
Maybe I should've done this sooner 
Maybe Tom will sell you his guitar 
Maybe Tom would be willing to help 
Maybe we can talk about that later

Young people are apt to waste time 
Your French has gotten much better

Are you sad?  No  Why would I be?

A short walk brought me to the lake 
A strange thing happened last night 
A terrible thing happened last week 
A valise of this size is very handy 
A woman appeared from behind a tree 
A world map shows all the countries 
Above all, don't forget to write me

All the eggs in the box were broken 
All three of us were at Tom's party 
All you can do is trust one another

There are a lot of bad people in the world 
There are a lot of dogs here, aren't there?
There are about a thousand students in all 
There are few mistakes in your composition 
There are fifty stars on the American flag 
There are footprints of a cat on the table 
There are many benefits to being beautiful 
There are many movie theaters in this city 
There are many people living in this house 
There are many tall buildings in that town 
There are more clouds today than yesterday 
There are more women than men in the world 
There are nine million bicycles in Beijing 
There are some things that money can't buy 
There are three hundred pages in this book 
There are very few passengers in the train 
There can be only one explanation for that 
There is a man waiting for you at the door 
There is a public telephone on that corner 
There is a reason that everybody hates Tom 
Hi, Tom  Come on in 
His bicycle is blue 
His dog barks at me 
His dream came true 
His eyes failed him 
His eyesight is bad 
His face brightened 
His family is large 
His heart is broken 
His jokes amused me 
His novel sold well 
His parents hate me 
His real name's Tom 
His shoes are brown 
His son is a genius 
His speech moved us 
His sweater is gray 
Hold on to the rope 
Hold the rope tight 
Holster your weapon 
Honesty doesn't pay 
Honey doesn't spoil 
How about I do that?
How about a rematch?
How about some milk?

I'm indebted to you 
I'm just about done 
I'm learning French 
I'm living my dream 
I'm looking for Tom 
I'm looking for you 
I'm making progress 
I'm more than happy 
I'm no good for you 
I'm no longer tired 
I'm not Tom's slave 
I'm not a bit tired 
I'm not a celebrity 
I'm not a good cook 
I'm not a good liar 
I'm not a scientist 
I'm not always busy 
I'm not backing out 
I'm not busy either 
I'm not coming back 
I'm not coming home 
I'm not complaining 
I'm not doing great 
I'm not eating this 
I'm not from Boston 
I'm not going to go 
I'm not in any pain 
I'm not in the mood 
I'm not incompetent 
I'm not interfering 
I'm not intimidated 
I'm not mad anymore 
I'm not married yet 
I'm not on the list 
I'm not one of them 
I'm not saying that 
I'm not so sure now 
I'm not telling you 
I'm not that hungry 
I'm not that naïve 
I'm not that stupid 
I'm not the manager 
I'm not the problem 
I'm not very hungry 
I'm not very strong 
I'm not your father 
I'm not your friend 
I'm not your mother 
I'm on the way home 
I'm only a customer 
I'm perfectly happy 
I'm practising judo 
I'm praying for Tom 
I'm prepared to die 
I'm proud of my son 
I'm proud of myself 
I'm quite satisfied 
I'm really confused 
I'm really grateful 
I'm resting my legs 
I'm right, aren't I?
I'm rooting for you 
I'm sad without you 
I'm sick of English 
I'm slightly hungry 
I'm so proud of Tom 
I'm so proud of you 
I'm sorry  I forgot 
I'm still in school 
I'm still undecided 
I'm still your boss 
I'm studying French 
I'm sure Tom's fine 
I'm sure about this 
I'm taking Tom home 
I'm taking this one 
I'm taking you home 
I'm taller than Tom 
I'm taller than you 
I'm the new teacher 
I'm the victim here 
I'm thinking of you 
I'm tired of Boston 
I'm tired of losing 
I'm traveling alone 
I'm trying to sleep 
I'm trying to study 
I'm up in the attic 
I'm used to waiting 
I'm usually on time 
I'm very busy today 
I'm very good at it 
I'm very happy here 
I'm very hungry now 
I'm very sleepy now 
I'm waiting for Tom 
I'm waiting for you 
I'm watching TV now 
I'm working on that 
I'm worried for you 
I'm your conscience 
I've become smarter 
I've been acquitted 
I've been listening 
I've been to church 
I've changed my job 
I've done it before 
I've got Tom's keys 
I've got a headache 
I've got a question 
I've got no friends 
I've got no worries 
I've got to do this 
I've got to find it 
I've got to see you 
I've had a busy day 
I've just come home 
I've just had lunch 
I've just turned 20 
I've lost a filling 
I've lost my pencil 
I've lost my ticket 
I've lost my wallet 
I've made Tom angry 
I've made a mistake 
I've met you before 
I've said I'm sorry 
I've seen that, too 
I've seen you on TV 
I've studied French 
Identify yourselves!
Is French difficult?
Is Santa Claus real?
Is Tom doing better?
Is Tom going to die?
Is Tom good-looking?
Is Tom still aboard?
Is Tom still around?
Is Tom still asleep?
Is Tom still coming?
Is Tom under arrest?
Is Tom your brother?
Is any of this true?
Is he looking at me?
Is his father alive?
Is it Japanese food?
Is it a big problem?
Is it a coincidence?
Is it far from here?
Is it getting worse?
Is it going to rain?
Is it going to snow?
Is it still raining?
Is it sweet or sour?
Is my laundry ready?
Is that OK with you?
Is that Tom singing?
Is that Tom's house?
Is that a complaint?
Is that a new dress?
Is that a new shirt?
Is that a submarine?
Is that a yes or no?
Is that all we need?
Is that book for me?
Is that clock going?
Is that from a book?
Is that one of ours?
Is that really true?
Is that so terrible?
Is that thing yours?
Is that your mother?
Is that your sister?
Is the bar open yet?
Is the dog swimming?
Is this OK with you?
Is this Tom's chair?
Is this all we need?
Is this goat cheese?
Is this good French?
Is this permissible?
Is this seat vacant?
Is this your flight?
Is this your letter?
Is this your pencil?
Is your father rich?
Is your mom at home?
Is your mother here?
Isn't that childish?
Isn't that overkill?
It cannot last long 
It could take hours 
It didn't cost much 
It doesn't worry me 
It expires tomorrow 
It finally happened 
It happened so fast 
It is a little cold 
It is freezing cold 
It is nothing to me 
It is only too true 
It is too expensive 
It is white as snow 
It isn't a hospital 
It isn't a prophecy 
It isn't about that 
It isn't hard to do 
It just didn't work 
It looks almost new 
It looks good to me 
It looks like a UFO 
It looks like a wig 
It looks ridiculous 
It made me very sad 
It makes me nervous 
It may be all right 
It may be important 
It may take a while 
It may well be true 
It never snows here 
It often rains here 
It often snows here 
It pays to tip well 
It rained yesterday 
It serves you right 
It shouldn't matter 
It smells delicious 
It snowed all night 
It snowed yesterday 
It tastes very good 
It took all evening 
It uses solar power 
It was a blow to us 
It was a busy night 
It was a compromise 
It was a dark night 
It was a great trip 
It was a little fun 
It was a lot of fun 
It was a nice party 
It was a stupid bet 
It was a tough call 
It was a true story 
It was all my fault 
It was almost funny 
It was an emergency 
It was child's play 
It was cold outside 
It was dark by then 
It was excruciating 
It was fine all day 
It was getting dark 
It was hard as rock 
It was his decision 
It was my first job 
It was only a dream 
It was pretty close 
It was quite simple 
It was rather funny 
It was really cheap 
It was really close 
It was really scary 
It was really sweet 
It was really windy 
It was seven thirty 
It was so beautiful 
It was such a shock 
It was the only way 
It was unbelievable 
It was unpardonable 
It was very helpful 
It was very strange 
It was worth a shot 
It wasn't expensive 
It wasn't important 
It wasn't real love 
It wasn't that hard 
It wasn't very good 
It works every time 
It would be perfect 
It'll be a good day 
It'll be a long day 
It'll be our secret 
It'll come in handy 
It'll rain for sure 
It'll rain tomorrow 
It'll snow tomorrow 
It'll work for sure 
It's Saturday today 
It's Tom's decision 
It's Tom's favorite 
It's a big hospital 
It's a brain-teaser 
It's a dreary place 
It's a fact of life 
It's a family trait 
It's a free country 
It's a huge mistake 
It's a large amount 
It's a minor glitch 
It's about this big 
It's all your fault 
It's almost October 
It's already eleven 
It's an inside joke 
It's an older model 
It's as cold as ice 
It's been wonderful 
It's cold out there 
It's dangerous here 
It's extremely ugly 
It's free of charge 
It's getting cloudy 
It's getting colder 
It's getting larger 
It's going to be OK 
It's going to break 
It's good, isn't it?
It's happened to me 
It's hip and trendy 
It's just a fantasy 
It's just a placebo 
It's kind of creepy 
It's moist and warm 
It's never too late 
It's not a big deal 
It's not about that 
It's not my problem 
It's not negotiable 
It's not real money 
It's not unheard of 
It's not worth much 
It's not your fault 
It's not your style 
It's only a placebo 
It's only a scratch 
It's only temporary 
It's part of my job 
It's pretty unusual 
It's slightly windy 
It's so complicated 
It's starting again 
It's still possible 
It's that important 
It's the same thing 
It's time for lunch 
It's time to get up 
It's time-consuming 
It's too hot for me 
It's too hot inside 
It's totally normal 
It's up to you, Tom 
It's very cold here 
It's very dangerous 
It's very difficult 
It's very effective 
It's very hot today 
It's worthless junk 
It's your own fault 
It's your turn, Tom 
Japanese are Asians 
Jesus answered them 
Jupiter is a planet 
Just follow my lead 
Just go and ask Tom 
Just go back to bed 
Just leave me alone 
Just tell the truth 
Keep an eye on them 
Keep away from that 
Keep going straight 
Keep it simple, Tom 
Keep me in the loop 
Keep your eyes open 
Keep your head down 
Kids can be so mean 
Large fries, please 
Lay it on the table 
Lead is easily bent 
Leave out this word 
Leave the door open 
Let Mary do her job 
Let Tom come aboard 
Let him do it alone 
Let me do it my way 
Let me go just once 
Let me have a taste 
Let me look into it 
Let me try it again 
Let me win for once 
Let the matter drop 
Let's all calm down 
Let's call a doctor 
Let's call it a day 
Let's check the map 
Let's do that again 
Let's do that first 
Let's do the dishes 
Let's do this later 
Let's end this fast 
Let's give it a try 
Let's go for a beer 
Let's go out to eat 
Let's go to a movie 
Let's have some fun 
Let's hope it works 
Let's look upstairs 
Let's make it brief 
Let's not overreact 
Let's not ruin this 
Let's open the wine 
Let's play baseball 
Let's start tonight 
Let's study English 
Let's try something 
Let's try this cake 
Let's watch a movie 
Let's work together 
Lie on your stomach 
Life is interesting 
Listen very closely 
Look after yourself 
Look at Tom's shoes 
Look at the picture 
Look at what I made 
Look me up sometime 
Look, I'll show you 
Looks are important 
Love is like oxygen 
Love is not a crime 
Luckily nobody died 
Make sure Tom comes 
Man, don't say that!
Many people do this 
Mary can dance well 
Mary has a headache 
Mary is a good girl 
Mary is my daughter 
Mary is my fiancée 
Mary is not my type 
Mary is very pretty 
May I ask your name?
May I drink alcohol?
May I interrupt you?
May I say something?
May I use the phone?
Maybe I fell asleep 
Maybe Tom can do it 
Maybe Tom is stupid 
Maybe Tom likes you 
Maybe Tom was right 
Maybe Tom was wrong 
Merlin was a wizard 
Mom is always right 
More coffee, please 
Mozart died in 1791 
My aunt looks young 
My back still hurts 
My boots were muddy 
My brother is a vet 
My car's over there 
My cat loves catnip 
My cat loves shrimp 
My computer crashed 
My dad will kill me 
My dog needs a walk 
My family loved Tom 
My feet are swollen 
My film has run out 
My foot fell asleep 
My friend helped me 
y friend is Indian 
My friend is Indian 
My goals are modest 
My hair is so dirty!
My hair is so messy!
My hair is too long 
My head is spinning 
My head still hurts 
My headache is gone 
My heart was racing 
My hobby is cooking 
My hobby is fishing 
My hobby is reading 
My home is far away 
My house is haunted 
My knee is bleeding 
My legs are hurting 
My life has changed 
My life was a wreck 
My mom will kill me 
My money was stolen 
My mother is active 
My name is Tom, too 
My neck still hurts 
My neighbor is nice 
My new shoes squeak 
My nose is bleeding 
My notebook is pink 
My parents are dead 
My phone is ringing 
My phone was broken 
My room key, please 
My room number is 5 
My shirt was ruined 
My sister has a job 
My sister is famous 
My sister is pretty 
My sister likes Tom 
My tea is too sweet 
My throat feels dry 
My trousers are wet 
My watch was stolen 
My whole body hurts 
My wife is a doctor 
My wife was a Smith 
My work is finished 
Never trust anybody 
No one ate anything 
No one believed him 
No one believes him 
No one came up here 
No one came with me 
No one can help Tom 
No one can help you 
No one can stop Tom 
No one could see us 
No one else laughed 
No one gave up hope 
No one has died yet 
No one has seen Tom 
No one knew a thing 
No one likes losing 
No one really knows 
No one was arrested 
No one was watching 
No one will do this 
No one will stop me 
No one will survive 
No, I don't want to 
No, that's not true 
Nobody answered Tom 
Nobody believed you 
Nobody bowed to him 
Nobody can help you 
Nobody can love him 
Nobody can stop Tom 
Nobody cares for me 
Nobody did anything 
Nobody even noticed 
Nobody saw anything 
Nobody speaks to me 
Nobody waits for me 
None of it was real 
Not everyone agreed 
Nothing can be done 
Nothing can stop it 
Nothing can stop me 
Nothing was working 
Now I recognize you 
Now eat your supper 
Now it's your serve 
Now let's celebrate 
Oh, give me a break 
Old habits die hard 
One fork is missing 
One of you is lying 
Only time will tell 
Open your eyes, Tom 
Our allies are weak 
Our plan has worked 
Our team is amazing 
Our team is winning 
Our team won 3 to 1 
Our time is limited 
Our work never ends 
Paper burns quickly 
Peaches taste sweet 
Peanuts aren't nuts 
People can be cruel 
People like to talk 
People love freedom 
Perhaps I was wrong 
Perhaps that's true 
Pizza is on the way 
Play me some Chopin

Possibly, it's true 
Prices are going up 
Put down the hammer 
Put on some clothes 
Put on this sweater 
Put on your blinker 
Put on your glasses 
Put on your pajamas 
Put some clothes on 
Put that in writing 
Put that knife away 
Put the bracelet on 
Put your books away 
Put your glasses on 
Quote me an example 
Rambo doesn't exist 
Read the book aloud 
Respect your elders 
Return to your seat 
Roll up your sleeve 
Rome is an old city 
Roses are beautiful 
See you around, Tom 
See you in two days 
Seeing is believing 
Send the bill to me 
She agreed with him 
She baked me a cake 
She became a doctor 
She became a singer 
She became very ill 
She blackmailed him 
She boiled the eggs 
She called for help 
She came out on top 
She can drive a car 
She can't afford it 
She can't cook well 
She cannot stop him 
She cooks very well 
She cried all night 
She danced with him 
She danced with joy 
She did pretty well 
She didn't like him 
She does look tired 
She does talk a lot 
She drives me crazy 
She feels bad today 
She gave him a book 
She gave me a watch 
She gave up smoking 
She has 2,000 books 
She has a few books 
She has a long nose 
She has a white cat 
She has faults, too 
She has few friends 
She has gone abroad 
She has lost weight 
She hasn't come yet 
She held her breath 
She hit me, not him 
She is a chatterbox 
She is a little shy 
She is a mere child 
She is about my age 
She is fond of cake 
She is good-natured 
She is growing tall 
She is in the wrong 
She is just a child 
She is looked up to 
She is loved by him 
She is my classmate 
She is not here yet 
She is not to blame 
She is only a child 
She is still a girl 
She is very healthy 
She is well off now 
She kept on talking 
She kept on working 
She kicked him hard 
She kicked the door 
She kissed my cheek 
She knows the truth 
She laced her shoes 
She likes all of us 
She likes that bass 
She lives in London 
She locked the door 
She looks very sick 
She made tea for me 
She opened her eyes 
She opened the door 
She pawned her gold 
She raised her hand 
She reserved a room 
She rubbed her eyes 
She sat next to him 
She seldom goes out 
She shaved her head 
She shaves her legs 
She speaks too much 
She still buys milk 
She still loved him 
She still loves him 
She stopped smoking 
She stopped talking

She turned him down 
She understands him 
She wants an iPad 4 
She was alone there 
She watched him eat 
She went for a walk 
She went on working 
She won the contest 
She won the lottery 
She won't like this 
She works all night 
She works at a bank 
She works in a bank 
She works very hard 
She's a good person 
She's a modern girl 
She's a tough woman 
She's a true artist 
She's also a beauty 
She's been poisoned 
She's getting older 
She's in a bad mood 
She's my first love

She's wearing a hat 
Sheep feed on grass 
Show me another bag 
Show me the picture 
Shut the door tight 
Shut up and kiss me 
Shut your big mouth 
Sign the guest book 
Slice the cucumbers 
So what else is new?
Some people like it 
Somebody intervened 
Somebody killed Tom 
Somebody touched me 
Someday, we'll know 
Something was wrong 
Something's burning 
Something's missing 
Something's strange 
Sorry for the delay 
Sorry to bother you 
Sorry, I can't help 
Step into the light 
Stop being so naive 
Stop being so picky 
Stop calling me Tom 
Stop criticizing me 
Stop fooling around!
Stop messing around 
Stop picking on Tom 
Stop playing around 
Stop that right now 
Stop, or I'll shoot 
Take Tom for a swim 
Take a look at that 
Take a look at this 
Take a seat, please 
Take my word for it 
Take off your shoes 
Take off your socks 
Take that one there 
Take the next right 
Take these with you 
Take your shoes off 
Talk to my attorney 
Tell Tom I love him 
Tell Tom I'm eating 
Tell Tom I'm joking 
Tell Tom what to do 
Tell her to call me 
Tell him to call me 
Tell me over dinner 
Tell me where he is 
Tell me who you saw 
Tell me you love me 
Tell them the truth 
Tell us who you are 
Thailand is in Asia 
Thank you for today 
Thank you very much 
Thanks all the same 
Thanks for the book 
Thanks for the cake 
Thanks for the food 
Thanks for the help 
Thanks for the hint 
Thanks for the info 
Thanks for the lift 
Thanks for the meal 
Thanks for the milk 
Thanks for the ride 
That TV is too loud 
That belongs to Tom 
That boy is running 
That can't be right 
That cannot be true 
That comes in handy 
That day shall come 
That didn't help us 
That does sound fun 
That doesn't happen 
That doesn't matter 
That dress is cheap 
That explains a lot 
That game is boring 
That hurts! Stop it!
That is a good idea 
That is my overcoat 
That is not a tiger 
That is not my line 
That isn't my fault 
That isn't our goal 
That joke was funny 
That looks like Tom 
That looks like tea 
That makes me angry 
That makes me happy 
That makes us happy 
That may not happen 
That ought to do it 
That rarely happens 
That sounds amazing 
That sounds awesome 
That student is Tom 
That was depressing 
That was impressive 
That was really bad 
That was really fun 
That was some storm 
That was unexpected 
That was very funny 
That wasn't so hard 
That won't help you 
That would be funny 
That would be great 
That would be lying 
That would be smart 
That'd be dangerous 
That'll be possible 
That's Tom's family 
That's Tom's father 
That's Tom's mother 
That's Tom's sister 
That's a blue house 
That's a good brand 
That's a good price 
That's a good thing 
That's a great idea!
That's a great idea 
That's a great name 
That's a great plan 
That's a great poem 
That's a lemon tree 
That's a lot to ask 
That's a new record 
That's a nice story 
That's a no-brainer 
That's a tall order 
That's all I can do 
That's all nonsense 
That's all they had 
That's all you need 
That's an exception 
That's an imitation 
That's an old trick 
That's child's play 
That's common sense 
That's discouraging 
That's embarrassing 
That's fine with me 
That's good to know 
That's his business 
That's how I see it 
That's how we do it 
That's it, isn't it?
That's just a start 
That's money wasted 
That's more like it 
That's no good, Tom 
That's not a secret 
That's not half bad 
That's not my fault 
That's not my thing 
That's not possible 
That's not the case 
That's not your cup 
That's quite absurd 
That's really sweet 
That's really weird 
That's self-evident 
That's sweet of you 
That's the attitude 
That's the only way 
That's too personal 
That's true as well 
That's unacceptable 
That's uncalled for 
That's what I heard 
That's what I think 
That's what I'll do 
That's what love is 
That's what they do 
That's what we want 
That's where I live 
That's where Tom is 
That's why I'm here 
That's why Tom came 
That's your funeral 
That's your problem 
The TV doesn't work 
The air became warm 
The answer is right 
The answer was easy 
The apples are ripe 
The auction is over 
The battery is dead 
The bell is ringing 
The bicycle is mine 
The blouse is clean 
The boy bowed to me 
The boy has no food 
The boys kept quiet 
The boys were quiet 
The bush is burning 
The butter went bad 
The button came off 
The car didn't move 
The car won't start 
The cat drinks milk 
The cat is adorable 
The cat is not dead 
The chair is broken 
The choice is yours 
The class went wild 
The cold is intense 
The computer is new 
The concert is over 
The crops need rain 
The crowd went wild 
The cup has a crack 
The damage was done 
The dog ate my shoe 
The dog bit my hand 
The dog bit the man 
The dog followed me 
The dog is bleeding 
The dog is sleeping 
The dog needs water 
The dog seems happy 
The dogs seem happy 
The door is closing 
The door was locked 
The door won't open 
The economy is good 
The file is corrupt 
The fire alarm rang 
The fish smells bad 
The food is spoiled 
The forest was dark 
The fridge is empty 
The girl is jumping 
The grapes are sour 
The group disbanded 
The house is pretty 
The house is vacant 
The idea is not bad 
The idea is not new 
The lake was frozen 
The law was changed 
The letter returned 
The lights went out 
The line is engaged 
The lion is roaring 
The list is endless 
The man took my arm 
The man was in rags 
The meat tastes bad 
The meat was tender 
The monkey got away 
The moon is shining 
The movie was awful 
The new car is hers 
The news shocked me 
The pay is terrible 
The people fear war 
The pie's delicious 
The plan has failed 
The plane flew east 
The police are here 
The pond froze over 
The pond was frozen 
The river has risen 
The room was locked 
The room was packed 
The scar is healing 
The server was down 
The ship is sinking 
The ship was at sea 
The sirens went off 
The sky turned dark 
The socks smell bad 
The soup is too hot 
The soup's very hot 
The stakes are high 
The storm continued 
The street is empty 
The street was dark 
The tower collapsed 
The victory is ours

We have to save Tom 
We have to stop Tom 
We have to tell Tom 
We have to warn him 
We hope we're wrong 
We just got started 
We just need a plan 
We know Tom is here 
We know where it is 
We know who you are 
We know you have it 
We laughed about it 
We liked each other 
We love coming here 
We love this school 
We made our demands 
We make a good team 
We may as well wait 
We missed our train 
We must act at once 
We must act quickly 
We must be cautious 
We must leave early 
We must not be late 
We must not do that 
We must pay the tax 
We must work faster 
We need a steamboat 
We need a volunteer 
We need an iron bar 
We need to act fast 
We need to get help 
We need to help Tom 
We obeyed the rules 
We often play chess 
We only kissed once 
We ran out of money 
We reached our goal 
We sat in the front 
We sat on the grass 
We sat side by side 
We saved you a seat 
We season with salt 
We should get going 
We should head home 
We should turn back 
We talked until two 
We thought you knew 
We traveled on foot 
We want out of here 
We want some advice 
We want to help Tom 
We want to help you 
We want to know why 
We want you to stop 
We wanted to listen 
We washed our hands 
We were all shocked 
We were all worried 
We were both hungry 
We were very hungry 
We will defeat them 
We will never agree 
We won't forget you 
We'd better find it 
We'd never hurt Tom 
We'll be seeing you 
We'll come together 
We'll come with you 
We'll do all we can 
We'll keep in touch 
We'll leave at 2:30 
We'll miss you, Tom 
We'll miss you, too 
We'll never make it 
We'll see you again 
We'll see you there 
We'll send somebody 
We'll soon find out 
We'll stop you, Tom 
We'll take Tom home 
We'll take you home 
We'll work tomorrow 
We're Tom's parents 
We're all prisoners 
We're always hungry 
We're among friends 
We're at home today 
We're being watched 
We're boiling water 
We're doing nothing 
We're eating apples 
We're finally alone 
We're finished here 
We're flabbergasted 
We're getting there 
We're getting tired 
We're going hunting 
We're going in here 
We're in the garden 
We're like brothers 
We're not giving up 
We're not going out 
We're not in Boston 
We're not in danger 
We're not like that 
We're not listening 
We're not strangers 
We're not surprised 
We're not very good 
We're on a schedule 
We're out of butter 
We're out of coffee 
We're playing cards 
We're short on time 
We're still friends 
We're still looking 
We're still working 
We're unimaginative 
We're very flexible 
We're very grateful 
We're working on it 
We've all done that 
We've already begun 
We've already eaten 
We've got a problem 
We've got a visitor 
We've got no brakes!
We've got no brakes!
We've got no choice 
We've got no choice 
We've got to go now 
We've made mistakes 
Welcome to our home

Write a short essay 
Yesterday I was ill 
You always say that 
You are a good cook 
You are always late 
You are lying to me 
You are quite a man 
You are such a liar!
You are such a liar 
You aren't Canadian 
You aren't thinking 
You aren't watching 
You bet I'm worried 
You broke the rules 
You can borrow mine 
You can call me Tom 
You can count on me 
You can go home now 
You can rely on her 
You can rely on him 
You can shower here 
You can shut up now 
You can sit with me 
You can take a taxi 
You can't blame him 
You can't defeat me 
You can't deny that 
You can't handle it 
You can't have both 
You can't have this 
You can't help them 
You can't just quit 
You can't leave now 
You can't leave yet 
You can't marry Tom 
You can't mean that 
You can't stay here

You know, don't you?
You lied to my face 
You look incredible 
You look like a boy 
You look like a cop 
You look pale today 
You look very happy 
You look very tired 
You lost an earring 
You may come in now 
You may go anywhere 
You may go home now 
You may laugh at me 
You may not come in 
You may not like it 
You must be careful 
You must be kidding!

You'll never change 
You'll pay for that 
You'll pay for this 
You'll see it again 
You're a bad person

Hi, Tom said shyly 
A cat has nine lives 
A horse is an animal 
A man must be honest 
A piano is expensive 
A squid has ten legs 
Add more water to it 
Admit it, we're lost 
All I have is a book 
All my friends do it 
All the meat was bad 
All we need is water 
Almost everyone came 
Am I really that bad?
Amputation is needed 
An ostrich can't fly 
Any child knows that 
Any of you can do it 
Anything is possible 
Anyway, you're wrong 
Apes are intelligent

Are your hands clean?
Aren't they adorable?
Aren't you a student?
Aren't you coming in?
Aren't you from here?
Aren't you in charge?
Aren't you listening?
Be proud of yourself 
Be quiet, all of you 
Beware of imitations 
Birds fly in the sky 
Blow out the candles 
Boston is a big city 
Both men were killed 
Both of you be quiet 
Boys are not welcome 
Bring me a dry towel 
Bring the laundry in 
Bring your kids, too 
Business is business 
But you're not there 
Buy the full version 
Call 110 immediately 
Call me this evening

Cats don't like dogs 
Cats have nine lives 
Cattle feed on grass 
Changes came quickly 
Children need loving 
Clean up the kitchen 
Colds are contagious 
Come and help me out 
Come and see me soon 
Come and take a look 
Come back in a month 
Come back in an hour 
Come fishing with me 
Come home before six 
Come in and sit down 
Come with me, please 
Context is important 
Cotton absorbs water 
Could I change rooms?
Could I get some tea?
Could we have a fork?
Count to one hundred

We'll look after Tom 
We'll look after you 
We'll meet Tom there 
We'll miss Tom a lot 
We'll think about it 
We're a happy family 
We're a little early 
We're all a team now 
We're always careful 
We're baking cookies 
We're being attacked 
We're both named Tom 
We're claustrophobic 
We're coming for you 
We're getting closer 
We're getting sloppy 
We're going to be OK 
We're going to fight 
We're going with you 
We're in third place 
We're looking for it 
We're not doing that 
We're not going home 
We're not terrorists 
We're not your enemy 
We're on the balcony 
We're planting seeds 
We're protecting you 
We're ready to leave 
We're ready, I think 
We're sorry about it 
We're still the best 
We're still together 
We're studying music 
We're the new owners 
We're too vulnerable 
We're very different 
We've arrived safely 
We've got each other 
We've run out of gas 
We've run out of tea 
We've seen it before

Don't touch the glass 
Don't waste your time 
Don't you like Boston?
Don't you like apples?
Don't you play tennis?
Eat anything you like 
Eat anything you like 
Eat it while it's hot 
Eat whatever you like 
Eggs are very fragile 
Eight plus two is ten 
Europe is a continent 
Even Tom spoke French 
Even the dog ran away 
Every dog has his day 
Everybody has secrets 
Everybody likes money 
Everybody loves music 
Everybody ran outside 
Everybody's different 
Everyone but Tom came 
Everyone else is fine 
Everyone has problems 
Everyone is an artist 
Everyone is different 
Everyone looked happy 
Everyone noticed that 
Everyone was confused 
Everyone was drinking 
Everything is working 
Everything looks good 
Everything went black 
Everything's changing 
Expect the unexpected 
Expectations were low 
Fancy seeing you here 
Fasten your seat belt 
Fasten your seatbelts 
Father drives to work 
Food is too expensive 
Fortune smiled on him 
Forty people attended 
French is spoken here 
Fur coats are on sale 
Get back in the house 
Get me some ice cubes 
Get out of my kitchen 
Get out while you can 
Get that away from me 
Get under my umbrella 
Get your hands off me 
Give it to me, please 
Give me a little time 
Give me just a little 
Give me my money back 
Give me your car keys 
Give this book to Tom 
Give us three minutes 
Glad to see you again 
Go to the living room 
God created the world 
God made the universe 
Goodbye and good luck 
Goodbye till tomorrow 
Guess what he told me 
Guess who I saw today 
Guys, we need to talk 
Hand in your homework 
Has Tom paid the rent?

Haven't we met before?

I lost a lot of blood 
I lost a lot of money 
I lost my credit card 
I lost my inspiration 
I love being with Tom 
I love being with you 
I love having no debt 
I love playing Chopin 
I love talking to you 
I love to watch anime 
I love what I'm doing 
I love you like a son 
I loved Tom very much 
I made a bad decision 
I made a couple calls 
I made a snack for us 
I made the first move 
I made you a bracelet 
I meant to look it up 
I met Tom in the park 
I met her by accident 
I met her last winter 
I met your girlfriend 
I miss my mom and dad 
I missed the last bus 
I misspelled the word 
I must be leaving now 
I must get some sleep 
I must have dreamt it 
I must hurry to class 
I must know the truth 
I must learn Japanese 
I must repay my debts 
I must repay the debt 
I need a bigger chair 
I need a box of nails 
I need a lot of books 
I need a new computer 
I need a new wardrobe 
I need about a minute 
I need help with this 
I need it by tomorrow 
I need some fresh air 
I need sunburn lotion 
I need to ask a favor 
I need to get a stamp 
I need to pay my rent 
I need to rent a room 
I need to talk to Tom 
I need to talk to him 
I need to talk to you

I need your help, Tom 
I never believed that 
I never drink at home 
I never forget a face 
I never hear anything 
I never heard him lie 
I never liked biology 
I never saw her again 
I never saw him again 
I never talked to Tom 
I no longer live here 
I no longer need them 
I no longer want that 
I no longer work here 
I often make mistakes 
I only eat vegetables 
I only have ten books 
I only need one thing 
I only use cane sugar 
I only work part-time 
I overslept yesterday 
I owe her 100,000 yen 
I owe you ten dollars 
I paid about 50 bucks 
I paid for it already 
I phone him every day 
I pigged out on pizza 
I postponed the event 
I prefer cats to dogs 
I prefer fish to meat 
I prefer to eat alone 
I promise not to sing 
I put it in your room 
I ran a race with Tom 
I rarely catch a cold 
I really am very busy 
I really enjoyed that 
I really feel for you 
I really miss my wife 
I really want to know 
I recognized his face 
I recognized the name 
I remember everything 
I remember it vividly 
I remember seeing her 
I remember seeing him 
I remember that laugh 
I require your advice 
I ride a bike to work 
I said I wasn't ready 
I said goodbye to Tom 
I saw Tom in the park 
I saw Tom play tennis 
I saw him in the park 
I saw that one coming 
I saw the whole thing 
I say it all the time 
I see a red car ahead 
I see what's going on 
I seldom speak to him 
I seldom walk to work 
I sent Tom my picture 
I shave every morning 
I should be at school 
I should be in charge 
I should go to Boston 
I should just go home 
I should learn French 
I should wash my hair 
I should've done that 
I should've gone home 
I should've said that 
I shouldn't have lied 
I signed the contract 
I sneeze all the time 
I speak English a lot 
I spoke French to Tom 
I spoke to Tom myself 
I spoke to my parents 
I stayed home all day 
I stayed up all night 
I still have your key 
I stopped going there 
I suppose that's true 
I swim in the morning 
I tend to catch colds

I think this is yours 
I think we can manage

I think we need those 
I think we'll be fine 
I think you know that 
I think you look fine 
I think you'd like it 
I think you're pretty 
I think you're stupid 
I thought I heard you 
I thought I was alone 
I thought I was dying 
I thought I'd be fine 
I thought he had died 
I thought he was sick 
I thought it was true 
I thought so at first 
I thought you knew me 
I threw away my shoes 
I told Tom I was fine 
I told Tom to do that 
I told Tom to go home 
I told her what to do 
I told him everything 
I took it for granted 
I tossed Tom the ball 
I tried to stay awake 
I turned the doorknob 
I understand that now 
I urgently need a job 
I used my imagination 
I used to be a dancer 
I used to be like you 
I used to hate Boston 
I usually get up late 
I walked about 1 mile 
I want Tom to be safe 
I want Tom to do that 
I want Tom to go home

I want you to see her 
I want you to take it 
I want you to want me 
I wanted to marry him 
I wanted to stay home 
I was Tom's secretary 
I was a healthy child 
I was a little afraid 
I was aching all over 
I was alone, studying 
I was angry at myself 
I was at my wit's end 
I was away for a year 
I was born in America 
I was born in October 
I was certainly lucky 
I was counting on you 
I was falsely accused 
I was filled with joy 
I was happy yesterday 
I was hardly prepared 
I was in the bathroom 
I was just devastated 
I was looking for Tom 
I was looking for you 
I was not a bit tired 
I was out celebrating 
I was quite surprised 
I was right about Tom 
I was so disappointed 
I was so unhappy then 
I was there yesterday 
I was totally shocked 
I was truly perplexed 
I was waiting for you 
I was wrong about you 
I wasn't always happy 
I wasn't at home then 
I wasn't disappointed 
I wasn't overly tired 
I wear contact lenses 
I went home and cried 
I went into the house 
I went to school here 
I went to the station 
I will get it for you 
I will give it to you 
I will make her happy 
I will need your help 
I will return at 6:30 
I wish I had seen her 
I wish I had your job 
I wish I hadn't cried 
I wish I was like him 
I wish I was with you 
I wish I were a stone 
I wish I were younger 
I wish I'd been there 
I wish I'd eaten more 
I wish Tom would stay 
I wish that were true 
I wish we'd done that 
I wish you could stay 
I wish you were wrong 
I wish you'd trust me 
I won fair and square 
I won't do that again 
I won't go back there 
I won't let you do it 
I won't pay this bill 
I won't see you again 
I won't take the bait 
I won't tolerate this 
I won't wash your car 
I won't work with him 
I wonder who they are 
I wonder why Tom left 
I work at the embassy 
I work even on Sunday 
I work for McDonald's 
I work for a hospital 
I work in the morning 
I would rather not go 
I would've liked that 
I wouldn't be so sure 
I wouldn't blame them 
I wrote Mary a letter 
I'd advise against it 
I'd bet my life on it 
I'd do it differently 
I'd do the same thing 
I'd double-check that 
I'd just like to talk 
I'd like a cup of tea 
I'd like not to do it 
I'd like some aspirin 
I'd like some privacy 
I'd like to apologize 
I'd like to buy a map 
I'd like to check out 
I'd like to go skiing 
I'd like to pay later 
I'd like to play golf 
I'd like to stay here 
I'd like to thank you 
I'd like you to drive 
I'd love to know that 
I'll ask Tom tomorrow 
I'll be busy tomorrow 
I'll be there all day 
I'll be there at 2:30 
I'll be there by 2:30 
I'll be there for you 
I'll call again later 
I'll call him tonight 
I'll call you tonight 
I'll come and get you 
I'll cross my fingers 
I'll do it my own way 
I'll do that for sure 
I'll do what Tom says 
I'll do what you want 
I'll find another job 
I'll find out for you 
I'll get some glasses 
I'll get that for you 
I'll get them for you 
I'll get you for this 
I'll give that to Tom 
I'll give that to you 
I'll give this to Tom 
I'll go get the broom 
I'll have to warn Tom 
I'll love you forever 
I'll make some coffee 
I'll make you a drink 
I'll miss you so much 
I'll never forget you 
I'll only be a second 
I'll pick him up at 5 
I'll see you Saturday 
I'll see you in class 
I'll see you in court 
I'll see you in there 
I'll show that to Tom 
I'll show you my room 
I'll show you the way 
I'll sleep in my room 
I'll stay if you want 
I'll take Tom to Mary 
I'll take care of you 
I'll take them to Tom 
I'll take this to Tom 
I'll take you with me 
I'll think about that 
I'm Tom's grandfather 
I'm Tom's grandmother 
I'm Tom's stepbrother 
I'm a big fan of golf 
I'm a college student 
I'm a country boy now 
I'm a little confused 
I'm a lot happier now 
I'm a married man now 
I'm a romantic person 
I'm a terrible dancer 
I'm about ready to go 
I'm afraid of heights 
I'm afraid of my boss 
I'm almost sure of it 
I'm always optimistic 
I'm as busy as Tom is 
I'm at the restaurant 
I'm being blackmailed 
I'm brushing my teeth 
I'm busy all the time 
I'm certain I saw Tom 
I'm charging my phone 
I'm coming in October 
I'm coming right away 
I'm coming to get you 
I'm confident in that 
I'm dreading the exam 
I'm easily influenced 
I'm eating dinner now 
I'm entirely to blame 
I'm finished with you 
I'm free this evening 
I'm from a big family 
I'm giving up smoking 
I'm glad I was nearby 
I'm glad Tom has gone 
I'm glad to hear that 
I'm going there alone 
I'm going to be there 
I'm going to go there 
I'm going to help you 
I'm going to hurt you 
I'm going to miss Tom 
I'm going to miss you 
I'm going to stop Tom 
I'm going to stop you 
I'm going to take off 
I'm going to the bank 
I'm going to the park 
I'm good at what I do 
I'm happy for you two 
I'm happy you're here 
I'm happy, very happy 
I'm having dinner now 
I'm here as a tourist 
I'm here for you, Tom 
I'm here to apologize 
I'm in love with Mary 
I'm just being honest 
I'm just being polite 
I'm just doing my job 
I'm kind of into that 
I'm leaving it to you 
I'm looking after Tom 
I'm looking for a job 
I'm no longer married 
I'm not Tom's brother 
I'm not Tom  I'm John 
I'm not a good artist 
I'm not a good person 
I'm not a good runner 
I'm not a kid anymore 
I'm not about to stop 
I'm not afraid at all 
I'm not an only child 
I'm not angry anymore 
I'm not ashamed of it 
I'm not at all scared 
I'm not bitter at all 
I'm not done with you 
I'm not easily fooled 
I'm not entirely sure 
I'm not even Canadian 
I'm not going to look 
I'm not going to lose 
I'm not going to stop 
I'm not happy with it 
I'm not here for that 
I'm not here to fight 
I'm not hungry at all 
I'm not in any danger 
I'm not in good shape 
I'm not made of money 
I'm not old fashioned 
I'm not proud of this 
I'm not really hungry 
I'm not satisfied yet 
I'm not scared at all 
I'm not scared of Tom 
I'm not sure about it 
I'm not sure actually 
I'm not taking credit 
I'm not that gullible 
I'm not too surprised 
I'm not uncomfortable 
I'm not very athletic 
I'm not wearing socks 
I'm not young anymore 
I'm not your daughter 
I'm now taking orders 
I'm often half asleep 
I'm on a fixed income 
I'm on my lunch break 
I'm on your side, Tom 
I'm only doing my job 
I'm out of place here 
I'm playing a TV game 
I'm reading this book 
I'm sick of hospitals 
I'm sorry I said that 
I'm sorry that I lied 
I'm still job hunting 
I'm still not married 
I'm studying with Tom 
I'm sure Tom is proud 
I'm sure Tom told you 
I'm swamped with work 
I'm taking it with me 
I'm talking about you 
I'm terrible at chess 
I'm the one they want 
I'm thinking about it 
I'm thinking of going 
I'm to blame, not you 
I'm trying not to cry 
I'm used to hard work 
I'm used to it by now 
I'm used to the noise 
I'm used to the smell 
I'm very broad-minded 
I'm very conservative 
I'm very disappointed 
I'm very discontented 
I'm very good at math 
I'm very hungry today 
I'm very proud of Tom 
I'm very proud of you 
I'm waiting out front 
I'm watching the news 
I'm working in Boston 
I'm worried about Tom 
I'm writing about you 
I've already told Tom 
I've always been here 
I've always hated Tom 
I've always hated you 
I've always liked Tom 
I've always loved you 
I've become forgetful 
I've been here before 
I've been to the bank 
I've been to the mall 
I've begun a new diet 
I've climbed Mt  Fuji 
I've come to save Tom 
I've found the answer 
I've given up smoking 
I've got a great idea 
I've got a stiff neck 
I've got bills to pay 
I've got half an hour 
I've got news for you 
I've got nothing left 
I've got the car keys 
I've got two brothers 
I've had a good sleep 
I've heard everything 
I've just been mugged 
I've just eaten lunch 
I've just gotten home 
I've lost my passport 
I've lost my strength 
I've made a discovery 
I've made my decision 
I've never beaten Tom 
I've never hit anyone 
I've often been there 
I've paid you already 
I've received threats 
I've run out of money 
I've seen your record 
I've thought about it 
I've tried everything 
Iceland was fantastic 
If I were you, I'd go 
If you wish, I'll ask 
In any case, we'll go 
Is Germany near Italy?
Is Mary a pretty girl?
Is Mary a real blonde?
Is Mary your daughter?
Is Tom a good swimmer?
Is Tom a good teacher?
Is Tom coming with us?
Is Tom getting better?
Is Tom going to be OK?
Is Tom going with you?
Is Tom ready to leave?
Is Tom still sleeping?
Is Tom still swimming?
Is all this necessary?
Is anyone else hungry?
Is anything happening?
Is everything OK here?
Is he afraid of death?
Is it OK to park here?
Is it October already?
Is it Tuesday already?
Is it a boy or a girl?
Is it a direct flight?
Is it an action movie?
Is it cold in Germany?
Is it near your house?
Is it really all over?
Is it really possible?
Is it really worth it?
Is it taking too long?
Is it too complicated?
Is it too far to walk?
Is somebody out there?
Is someone calling me?
Is that a common name?
Is that a new perfume?
Is that a yes or a no?
Is that an invitation?
Is that clock working?
Is that how you do it?
Is that something new?
Is that too difficult?
Is that what Tom said?
Is that what Tom says?
Is that what he wants?
Is that what it takes?
Is that what you said?
Is that what you want?
Is that your new book?
Is that your umbrella?
Is there a dress code?
Is there a school bus?
Is there another door?
Is there anything new?
Is there life on Mars?
Is there no other way?
Is there some problem?
Is this biodegradable?
Is this going to hurt?
Is this good material?
Is this seat reserved?
Is this what you want?
Is this your homework?
Is this your suitcase?
Is this your umbrella?
Is tomorrow a holiday?
Is your headache gone?
Is your watch correct?
Isn't it your day off?
Isn't life just great?
Isn't the answer easy?
It almost made me cry 
It can be frustrating 
It cost me 10 dollars 
It could be important 
It could have been me 
It didn't hurt at all 
It didn't really hurt 
It doesn't matter now 
It frosted last night 
It gave me the creeps 
It happened in Boston 
It happened last year 
It happened naturally 
It happened very fast 
It happens frequently 
It has been confirmed 
It has been wonderful 
It is a very sad tale 
It is beyond my power 
It is good to see you 
It is highly improper 
It is of little value 
It is too hot to work 
It is too warm for me 
It is true in a sense 
It is very cold today 
It is what I would do 
It isn't at all clear 
It isn't here anymore 
It isn't much further 
It made me very happy 
It made my mother cry 
It makes me feel sick 
It may save your life 
It might be a wedding 
It might be important 
It might prove useful 
It only happened once 
It reminded me of you 
It runs in the family 
It scares me to death 
It seemed appropriate 
It seemed to be cheap 
It seems warm outside 
It serves our purpose 
It should be possible 
It smells bad in here 
It smells like a trap 
It sounds interesting 
It started as a hobby 
It starts around 8:30 
It still doesn't work 
It sure is cold today 
It takes two to tango 
It tastes really good 
It took a lot of time 
It was Saturday night 
It was a good example 
It was a group effort 
It was a huge success 
It was a little scary 
It was a magic moment 
It was a terrible day 
It was all Tom's idea 
It was amazingly easy 
It was cold in Boston 
It was cold yesterday 
It was easy to answer 
It was extremely cold 
It was hot last night 
It was not unexpected 
It was pretty obvious 
It was quite pleasant 
It was real hard work 
It was three days ago 
It was to be expected 
It was totally secret 
It was very confusing 
It wasn't an accident 
It wasn't intentional 
It wasn't you, was it?
It will clear up soon 
It will do harm to us 
It will rain tomorrow 
It will snow tomorrow 
It won't be a problem 
It won't be that easy 
It won't be that hard 
It won't be that long 
It won't come to that 
It won't happen again 
It won't happen to me 
It won't stop raining 
It won't take so long 
It would be confusing 
It'll definitely rain 
It'll get warmer soon 
It'll soon be October 
It's 2:30 by my watch 
It's Monday, you know 
It's a bad investment 
It's a beautiful song 
It's a fine day today 
It's a matter of time 
It's a necessary evil 
It's a nice day today 
It's a quarter to two 
It's a riveting story 
It's a slippery slope 
It's a trap, isn't it?
It's a very clear day 
It's a very sad story 
It's a waste of money 
It's a welcome change 
It's about to explode!
It's all quite simple 
It's all that matters 
It's already midnight 
It's already too late 
It's always like that 
It's amazingly simple 
It's bad for business 
It's been a hard year 
It's been a long time 
It's been a long week 
It's driving me crazy 
It's easy to hear you 
It's expensive though 
It's from your family 
It's going to be fine 
It's going to be good 
It's great to be here 
It's great to see you 
It's hard to describe 
It's hot in this room 
It's important to Tom 
It's insanely complex 
It's just a formality 
It's just so exciting 
It's just that simple 
It's midnight already 
It's more than enough 
It's my birthday soon 
It's my favorite food 
It's my favorite song 
It's not a fair fight 
It's not hard to find 
It's not quite enough 
It's not so hot today 
It's not true anymore 
It's not very durable 
It's not what we want 
It's not why I'm here 
It's obviously a typo 
It's one of our rules 
It's our duty to help 
It's probably haunted 
It's quite warm today 
It's really cool here 
It's really hot there 
It's really important 
It's self-explanatory 
It's starting to snow 
It's still true today 
It's time for a break 
It's tough to explain 
It's up to you and me 
It's useless to argue 
It's very complicated 
It's very hot in here 
It's very interesting 
It's very nice of you 
It's very windy today 
It's what I'm used to 
It's what you deserve 
It's your only chance 
It's your problem now 
It's your turn to pay 
Jesus was a carpenter 
Just a moment, please 
Just do what Tom says 
Just say you're sorry 
Just sit down and eat 
Just use mine for now 
Just wait for us here 
Just you wait and see 
Keep in touch with me 
Keep next Monday free 
Keep next Sunday free 
Keep that to yourself 
Keep the windows open 
Keep up the good work 
Keep your eyes peeled!
Keep your hands still 
Knock before entering 
Lawyers are all liars 
Lay this aside for me 
Learn those sentences 
Leave it off the list 
Leave my camera alone 
Leave my family alone 
Leave my things alone 
Let Tom have his turn 
Let in some fresh air 
Let me drive you home 
Let me fix the switch 
Let me give you a hug 
Let me see you eat it 
Let me try that again 
Let sleeping dogs lie 
Let the children play 
Let them do their job 
Let's ask Tom to help 
Let's ask the teacher 
Let's build something 
Let's call it a night 
Let's eat out tonight 
Let's escape together 
Let's get off the bus 
Let's get some coffee 
Let's get started, OK?
Let's give it a whirl 
Let's go and find Tom 
Let's go to my office 
Let's go to the beach 
Let's have a go at it 
Let's help each other 
Let's just be friends 
Let's leave her alone 
Let's meet again soon 
Let's not rush things 
Let's open the window 
Let's play volleyball 
Let's review Lesson 5 
Let's see you do that 
Let's share the money 
Let's sit in the back 
Let's speak in French 
Let's start with beer 
Let's take the stairs 
Lie on your left side 
Life is unpredictable 
Like father, like son 
Listen to your father 
Listen to your mother 
Logging is prohibited 
Look at that building 
Look at that mountain 
Look at the next page 
Look how happy Tom is 
Look what we've found 
Look what you've done 
Loud music bothers me 
Make yourself at home 
Many people are upset 
Many people shop here 
Mark the right answer 
Mary broke up with me 
Mary could be a model 
Mary has her problems 
Mary is Tom's ex-wife 
Mary is a good mother 
Mary is a hula dancer

Someone asked for you 
Someone took my place 
Someone took my stuff 
Something has changed 
Something is going on

Strange things happen 
Summer has just begun 
Supper's getting cold 
Tadpoles become frogs 
Take a walk every day 
Take care of yourself 
Take me home with you 
Take me to your place 
Take off your clothes 
Take off your glasses 
Take us with you, Tom 
Teach me how to do it 
Tears came to my eyes 
Tell Tom I'll be back 
Tell Tom what this is 
Tell Tom what's wrong

Tell me it's not true 
Tell me something new 
Tell me what Tom said 
Tell me what happened

That banana is rotten 
That cannot be denied 
That car is quite new 
That cost him his job 
That could take hours 
That could take weeks 
That didn't take long 
That dog doesn't bite 
That dog is so stupid 
That guy is an outlaw 
That house is haunted 
That is going too far 
That is my own affair 
That is too expensive 
That isn't my problem 
That made me very sad 
That man is a soldier 
That man was a wretch 
That might be helpful 
That should be enough 
That smells delicious 
That sounds beautiful 
That sounds promising 
That task wasn't easy 
That was a close call 
That was a funny joke 
That was a good steak 
That was all Tom said 
That was an awful day 
That was embarrassing 
That was pretty funny 
That was pretty scary 
That was really scary 
That was really sweet 
That was sweet of you 
That was unbelievable 
That was unforgivable 
That was very helpful 
That wasn't a mistake 
That wasn't necessary 
That wasn't our fault 
That wasn't very nice 
That water pipe leaks 
That works every time 
That would be logical 
That would be perfect 
That would be prudent 
That wouldn't be fair 
That wouldn't be good 
That'll make me happy 
That's Tom's decision 
That's a direct order 
That's a good picture 
That's a little weird 
That's a lot of money 
That's a minor detail 
That's a nice T-shirt 
That's a nice picture 
That's a pretty dress 
That's an odd request 
That's an old picture 
That's another matter 
That's awesome, right?
That's good, isn't it?
That's how Tom did it 
That's how it is done 
That's just an excuse 
That's not a bad idea 
That's not a solution 
That's not acceptable 
That's not even funny 
That's not my concern 
That's not my opinion 
That's not my problem 
That's not what I saw 
That's not what we do 
That's not why I came 
That's one of my cats 
That's one of my dogs 
That's part of my job 
That's pretty obvious 
That's pretty serious 
That's quite possible 
That's the last straw!
That's the last straw 
That's the main thing 
That's their business 
That's to be expected 
That's totally normal 
That's understandable 
That's utter nonsense 
That's very dangerous 
That's very good news 
That's very, very sad 
That's what I thought 
That's what I'm doing 
That's what Tom wants 
That's what you think 
That's where we'll go 
That's why I like Tom 
That's why I like you 
That's why I love you 
That's why I was late 
That's why we're here 
That's why you pay us 
That's your own fault 
The Jacksons are here 
The airplane is ready 
The airport is closed 
The antelope ran away 
The baby is screaming 
The baby smiled at me 
The bear ate an apple 
The bed is still warm 
The birds are singing 
The birds were hungry 
The black one is mine 
The bookstore is open 
The box was too heavy 
The boy is over there 
The boy threw a stone 
The boys were injured 
The brake didn't work 
The bullet missed Tom 
The bus has just left 
The cake is delicious 
The candle burned out 
The cat ate the mouse 
The cat hissed at Tom 
The chairs stack well 
The child will be six 
The children are cold 
The children are gone 
The children are safe 
The children loved it 
The concert was awful 
The container is full 
The crowd calmed down 
The danger is minimal 
The data was accurate 
The decision is final 
The decision is yours 
The die has been cast 
The dog growled at me 
The dog is biting Tom 
The door creaked open 
The door slammed shut 
The doors were closed 
The engine is purring 
The experiment failed 
The faucet is leaking 
The feeling is mutual 
The files are missing 
The fog began to lift 
The food is delicious 
The girl said nothing 
The girl smiled at me 
The girls are excited 
The girls were crying 
The goal was achieved 
The goldfish is alive 
The guitar is in tune 
The heart is a muscle 
The honeymoon is over 
The hotel burned down 
The house caught fire 
The hunter shot a fox 
The ice is very thick 
The kids are sleeping 
The king was executed 
The kitchen was clean 
The lake is deep here 
The lake is very deep 
The line isn't moving 
The lock is beautiful 
The man lost all hope 
The man's name is Tom 
The meat has gone bad 
The milk has gone bad 
The money disappeared 
The moon has come out 
The more, the merrier 
The morning was clear 
The mountain is green 
The music is too loud 
The news made her sad 
The noise woke her up 
The old man looks sad 
The other boys smiled 
The pain is agonizing 
The pain was terrible 
The park was deserted 
The patient got worse 
The pie was delicious 
The pizza tasted good 
The plan was executed 
The pleasure was mine 
The pond has dried up 
The pond is very deep 
The price has gone up 
The price is going up 
The problem is solved 
The problem isn't Tom 
The radio is too loud 
The results were good 
The rice is delicious 
The riot was put down 
The rumor may be true 
The rumors were false 
The secret leaked out 
The situation is dire 
The sky's clear today 
The soldiers are dead 
The soup is too salty 
The spider spun a web 
The stars are shining 
The station is nearby 
The story sounds true 
The story was amusing 
The streets are clean 
The streets are dirty 
The students are back 
The sun is already up 
The sun is in the sky 
The sun is rising now 
The sun will soon set 
The surgery went well 
The suspect confessed 
The thief ran quickly 
The three men laughed 
The town was deserted 
The treaty was signed 
The typhoon hit Tokyo 
The waiter ignored me 
The war ended in 1945 
The war ended in 1954 
The water is lukewarm 
The whale is a mammal 
The windows were open 
The world has changed 
Their car passed ours 
Their hands were cold 
Their son grew bigger 
There are many others 
There are no problems 
There are three of us 
There has to be a way 
There is a better way 
There is no milk left 
There is no one there 
There is no other way 
There is no salt left 
There is nothing here 
There is someone here 
There was an accident 
There was one witness 
There's a big problem 
There's a grease spot 
There's a little wind 
There's a yellow rose 
There's no free lunch 
There's no going back 
There's no sugar here 
There's no wind today 
There's nobody inside 
There's nothing there 
There's nothing to do 
There's nothing to it 
These are my brothers 
These are my students 
These are your orders 
These are your things 
These grapes are ripe 
These pants are dirty 
These shoes don't fit 
They all looked happy 
They all speak French 
They are the same age 
They aren't like that 
They aren't that good 
They arrived too soon 
They ate marshmallows 
They both like sports 
They both look so sad 
They bought a new car 
They burst into tears 
They can't believe it 
They can't make us go 
They closed the doors 
They come from Sweden 
They didn't choose me 
They don't have a car 
They don't understand 
They exchanged hellos 
They found each other 
They hated each other 
They know how to swim 
They know their stuff 
They know who you are 
They look alike to me 
They made fun of Mary 
They made me go there 
They may be in danger 
They meet once a week 
They missed the train 
They never apologized 
They never tell a lie 
They offered it to me 
They refused to fight 
They remained friends 
They sat side by side 
They saw us yesterday 
They say I'm retarded 
They scorned the liar 
They settled in Japan 
They shared the money 
They started shooting 
They stopped laughing 
They talked all night 
They talked for hours 
They tried everything 
They trust each other 
They used truth serum 
They want us to do it 
They wash their hands 
They watched intently 
They were never alone 
They were not pleased 
They were really cold 
They were unimpressed 
They were very hungry 
They weren't bluffing 
They will never agree 
They won't believe me 
They'll look after me 
They'll love that one 
They'll never make it 
They'll understand us 
They're able students 
They're afraid of Tom 
They're afraid of him 
They're eating apples 
They're expecting you 
They're gaining on us 
They're in math class 
They're in the garden 
They're in the shower 
They're just students 
They're my classmates 
They're not criminals 
They're playing cards 
They're still stunned 
They're too dangerous 
They're unpredictable 
They're up to no good 
They've been arrested 
They've changed a lot 
They've still got Tom 
Think before you leap 
Think of your brother 
Think outside the box 
This I can agree with 
This all sounds great 
This bag is not small 
This bag is too heavy 
This bicycle is Tom's 
This blouse is cotton 
This book is very new 
This building is huge 
This can't be avoided 
This car handles well 
This car has an alarm 
This car needs washed

This could take hours 
This curry is too hot 
This fruit tastes bad 
This game was put off 
This gift is from Tom 
This is Tom's bicycle 
This is a Chinese fan 
This is a company car 
This is a crazy world 
This is a free sample 
This is a good system 
This is a joke, right?
This is a large house 
This is a stupid idea 
This is a wooden comb 
This is a yellow rose 
This is all our fault 
This is an apple tree 
This is an epic novel 
This is going too far 
This is how I made it 
This is how you do it 
This is inappropriate 
This is just too much 
This is my dictionary 
This is my first time 
This is my last offer 
This is my new guitar 
This is not important 
This is not my ticket 
This is our only hope 
This is so unlike you 
This is something new 
This is the Town Hall 
This is the easy part 
This is the hard part 
This is the last game 
This is the last time 
This is too expensive!
This is too expensive 
This is where we live 
This isn't a hospital 
This isn't about that 
This isn't your house 
This made me very sad 
This makes me curious 
This meat cuts easily 
This milk tastes sour 
This news is official 
This one's on us, Tom 
This pear smells nice 
This room is for VIPs 
This room is for rent 
This sentence is fine 
This should be enough 
This should be washed 
This shower is broken 
This soup tastes good 
This spoon is for tea 
This string is strong 
This sure tastes good!
This tea is very good 
This textbook is good 
This time I'll try it 
This was a great idea 
This was a lot of fun 
This window is broken 
This wine tastes good 
This works every time 
Those are empty words 
Those are my trousers 
Those are their books 
Those are your orders 
Those photos are hers 
Throw him in the brig 
Throw the ball to Tom 
Time cures all things 
Time heals all wounds 
Time is getting short 
Time is on their side 
Time is running short 
Time waits for no one 
Tips are not accepted 
Today is October 20th

It almost worked 
It began to rain 
It began to snow 
It belongs to us 
It can't be done 
It can't be true 
It could be true 
It couldn't hurt 
It happened fast 
It interested me 
It is impossible 
It is not my day 
It is time to go 
It is very small 
It isn't a dream 
It isn't obvious 
It looks so real 
It made me think 
It makes me sick 
It matters to me 
It matters to us 
It needs washing 
It never existed 
It seemed normal 
It seems strange 
It should be fun 
It sounds simple 
It takes courage 
It took too long 
It was a hot day 
It was a mistake 
It was good news 
It was his fault 
It was so simple 
It was the truth 
It was very cold 
It was very hard 
It was very ugly 
It was your idea 
It wasn't enough 
It won't be easy 
It won't be long 
It wouldn't hurt 
It'll snow today 
It's Tom's fault 
It's Tom's fight 
It's Tom's group 
It's Tom's house 
It's Tom's phone 
It's Tom's voice 
It's a bad habit 
It's a big world 
It's a done deal 
It's a dream job 
It's a full moon 
It's a good book 
It's a good deal 
It's a good plan 
It's a good rule 
It's a mad world 
It's a sunflower 
It's a sunny day 
It's a windy day 
It's all in here 
It's almost dark 
It's almost over 
It's almost time 
It's an illusion 
It's bad for you 
It's become dark 
It's bitter cold 
It's clearing up 
It's comfortable 
It's complicated 
It's conceivable 
It's dark inside 
It's far-fetched 
It's frozen hard 
It's getting hot 
It's going great 
It's gotten dark 
It's hard to say 
It's hit or miss 
It's hot in here 
It's in the well 
It's interesting 
It's just a cold 
It's just a game 
It's laundry day 
It's like a drug 
It's magnificent 
It's monkey meat 
It's my umbrella 
It's not a dream 
It's not a watch 
It's not for you 
It's not from me 
It's not illegal 
It's not serious 
It's not too hot 
It's now my turn 
It's on the sofa 
It's one of mine 
It's only Monday 
It's pretty cold 
It's pretty cool 
It's pretty ugly 
It's quite large 
It's rainy today 
It's rather cold 
It's regrettable 
It's snowing now 
It's still alive 
It's supper time 
It's that simple 
It's their fault 
It's their right 
It's transparent 
It's unnecessary 
It's very bitter 
It's very sticky 
It's what I like 
It's what I want 
It's worth a try 
Japan is in Asia 
Just a moment    
Just be yourself 
Just call me Tom 
Just do your job 
Just follow them 
Just get to work 
Just keep moving 
Just look at Tom 
Keep a cool head 
Keep me informed 
Keep the dog out 
Keep to the left 
Leave everything 
Leave that alone 
Leave that there 
Leave that to me 
Leave them alone 
Leave this to me 
Let Tom carry it 
Let go of my arm!
Let go of my arm 
Let me do my job 
Let me handle it 
Let me repair it 
Let me try again 
Let them come in 
Let's be friends 
Let's cross here 
Let's do our job 
Let's follow Tom 
Let's get inside 
Let's get moving 
Let's go dancing 
Let's go see Tom 
Let's have a try 
Let's have lunch 
Let's have sushi 
Let's keep quiet 
Let's play cards 
Let's play house 
Let's play poker 
Let's skip lunch 
Let's start here 
Let's take a bus 
Lie on the couch 
Light the candle 
Listen carefully 
Listen to me, OK?
Look at it again 
Look at that dog 
Look at that man 
Look at that one 
Look at the moon 
Look at this one 
Look out for Tom 
Look what I made 
Look who's there 
Lower your voice 
Mail this letter 
Make way, please 
Make your choice 
Many people died 
Mars is a planet 
Mary is a mother 
Mary is a tomboy 
Mary is charming 
Mary is graceful 
Mary is my niece 
Mary is pregnant 
Mary slapped Tom 
Mary, I love you 
May I call later?
May I come again?
May I touch this?
May we swim here?
Maybe I can help 
Maybe he was ill 
Maybe it'll snow 
My brain is full 
My car is German 
My cat is hungry 
My eyes are blue 
My eyes are sore 
My father is out 
My father smokes 
My feet are numb 
My glass is full 
My goldfish died 
My house is tiny 
My inbox is full 
My job is boring 
My mother is out 
My mouth was dry 
My nose is itchy 
My pencil is red 
My place is here 
My shoes got wet 
My stomach hurts 
My toy is broken 
My uncle is rich 
My wallet's gone 
My wife beats me 
Neither was true 
Never tell a lie 
Nice to meet you 
No one asked you 
No one helped me 
No one is coming 
No one knew that 
No one knows why 
No one knows yet 
No one likes Tom 
No one likes war 
No one likes you 
No one loves war 
No one loves you 
No one responded 
No one says that 
No one warned me 
No one was alive 
No one was there 
No one will care 
No one will know 
No one's looking 
No one's perfect 
No pain, no gain!
Nobody asked Tom 
Nobody does that 
Nobody knows why 
Nobody liked Tom 
Nobody likes Tom 
Nobody likes her 
Nobody likes war 
Nobody loves war 
Nobody must know 
Nobody remembers 
Nobody taught me 
Nobody wants Tom 
Nobody will know 
Nobody's perfect 
Nothing happened 
Now I understand 
Now, don't panic 
Now, where was I?
OK, I heard that 
OK, I understand 
OK, let me drive 
OK, let's go now 
OK, listen to me 
OK, thanks a lot 
OK, thanks again 
OK, wish me luck 
Obey your father 
Oh no, not again!
Oh, have a heart 
Open the windows 
Open up the door 
Our kids hate us 
Pass me the salt 
People are dying 
People need love 
Perhaps Tom left 
Perhaps it's Tom 
Please answer me 
Please be gentle 
Please be honest 
Please be polite 
Please be seated 
Please come here 
Please don't ask 
Please don't cry 
Please don't die!
Please don't die 
Please follow me 
Please let me go 
Please let me in 
Please phone him 
Please sign here 
Please step back 
Please turn over 
Please wait here 
Prepare yourself 
Pump up the tire 
Put on your coat 
Put the box down 
Put the gun down 
Quit complaining 
Quit touching me 
Rabbits can swim 
Raise your hands 
Read that for me 
Reality is scary 
Red wine, please 
Respect yourself 
Rome is in Italy 
Say hello to Tom 
Say it in French 
Say you're sorry 
School is boring 
School's not fun 
See you in class 
See you tomorrow 
Shall I help you?
She attacked him 
She became happy 
She began crying 
She betrayed you 
She came running

She didn't reply 
She died from TB 
She died in 1960

She made him cry 
She may not come 
She must be sick 
She needs a coat 
She quit smoking 
She rejected him 
She rode a camel 
She said goodbye 
She smiled at me 
She smiled sadly 
She smokes a lot 
She stared at me 
She stood by him 
She studies hard 
She surprised me 
She talked a lot 
She took my hand 
She was homesick 
She was promoted 
She was swimming 
She wore glasses 
She worships him 
She's a bad liar 
She's helping me 
She's nice to me 
She's not a liar 
She's very upset 
Should we try it?
Sit at the table 
Sit down, please 
Snakes are scary 
So what happened?
Somebody help me 
Somebody laughed 
Somebody saw you 
Someone is lying 
Someone screamed 
Someone's coming 
Sorry about that 
Sorry to be late 
Speak to me, Tom 
Spiders scare me 
Stand up, please 
Stay for a while 
Stay out of this 
Stop being cruel 
Stop complaining 
Stop daydreaming 
Stop hitting Tom 
Stop lying to me 
Stop right there 
Stop saying that!
Stop saying that 
Stop scaring Tom 
Stop showing off!
Stop teasing Tom 
Summer has ended 
Summer is coming 
Swimming is easy 
Take Tom outside 
Take Tom's place 
Take a good look 
Take a look, Tom 
Take us with you
