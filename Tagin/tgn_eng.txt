Okay Mother, I will go to school.
Let's go.
Pungto, take care of your sister okay, don't let her hurt okay?
Brother-Brother, are we not going to school?
Now we will not go we will not be able to reach on time, sir will beat us.
So let's roam here-and-there together.
Oh no, who are they that is stealing my guava? You children wait.
Whose monkey's children are they? Don't dare comeback again!
If you dare comeback again, I will break one of your legs into pieces and keep it, little monsters, keep that it mind.
I got fish. Mai, come here. Mai takecare of this fish okay? I'm going to catch more fish.
Oh no!! Where did the fish go? Don't let it escape again.
Oh no!! Again you let the fish escape!? You stay here.
Pungto? Yes brother. What are you doing? You didn't go to school? Yes I did. Let's go to my house and watch TV. Take your bag too.
Sister? inform my mother and father okay, that tonight I will be sleeping in my brother's house.
Pungto, why didn't you bring your sister with you? Oh no!!
Mai! Mai! Mai where have you gone? Mai where are you?
I have found a child she is here, come and take her away. Come quickly and take the child away, she is here with me since last night.
Oh ho, you lost your sister and didn't try to find her. Where were you roaming?
After all you are just a child, your sister was lost, you didn't even try to find her, tied and left her. Didn't think if wild animals would have killed her.
Yesterday if I didn't found her and let her stay for a night, then wild animals would have killed her already.
You kid, take your sister home. A big brother never does that.
Should love your sister, and should take her wherever you go by holding her hand tightly.
Don't repeat it again okay?
